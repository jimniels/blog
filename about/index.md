In the past, I frequently put off writing blog posts because I found myself unable to put forth my best effort in writing — that attitude of “if you can’t do something right, don’t do it at all” — but lately I’ve found myself regretting not writing at least *something*.

This is the lens through which I’ve come to view my blog posts these days, like a lax journal.

I have all these ambitions to write but then I don’t. Now I’ve arrived at this point of thinking “well *something* is better than *nothing*”. So, many of the posts on my blog are me just trying to write *something* down before I forget it all. I’ve found I enjoy the nostalgia of going back after a year and being like “oh yeah, that thing”. Like a nostaligic photograph.

On this blog, I often don’t take the effort I should to craft what I’m writing  so by the end of the post I feel like “well I’ll just publish it and maybe come back and do more proof reads” but at that point I know I’m just lying to myself by saying that.

But hey, like I said, these days I’m aiming for my blog posts to basically be a bad journal entry.
