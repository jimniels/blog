# How this works:
#
# URL: /.netlify/functions/preferences | FILE: netlify/functions/preferences.js
#   This sets/modifies a cookie for the client so Netlify can rewrite requests
# FILE: netlify.toml
#   Contains the rewrite rules
# FILE: build/_fidelity/{low|med}
#   Contains the same version of the site, but with fidelity stripped out
#   of the default version of the site (which lives at `build/`)
# 
# Of note: "low" and "med" are the two enumerated values used in:
#   - The cookies
#       e.g. `fidelity-low=active` or `fidelity-med=active`
#   - The redirect rules
#       e.g. a request to `/about/` with `fidelity-low=active` rewrites to
#       `/_fidelity/low/about/(index.html)`
#   - The build directories
#       e.g. a version of the site is generated for each fidelity and stuck
#       in the `/_fidelity` folder, i.e. `_fidelity/low/`
