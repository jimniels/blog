Have you ever heard this saying before, “You know what happens when you assume? It makes an A-S-S out of U and ME”? Well, that’s true of design assumptions too. Let me explain.

Occasionally I receive emails from friends sharing content from a website or app. Generally the email follows this pattern:

    Hi,

    [Personalized message from sender here]

    I thought you’d like this:
    [Shortened URL here]

    [Article title here]
    [Article summary/description here]

    This email message is powered by [service name] etc.

Normally, this works fine. When User A shares something with User B, it’s generally assumed User A is saying, “Hey, I thought you’d like this”; hence the verbiage of the email. That, however, is an assumption that could easily be wrong. A service could inject first-person wording that speaks on behalf of the sender (“I thought you’d like this”) but mistakenly expresses a sentiment the sender did not intend.

Let me illustrate: if you send an article to a friend about some death, sickness, or devastation they’ve recently experienced, you’re probably not going to say, “I thought you’d like this”. Having a computer inject words that speak on your behalf, like “I thought you’d like this” is *incredibly* impersonal.

So, if you’re designing such a system, tread softly when it comes to speaking on behalf of the user. Injecting “you might like this” as a user’s voice is an awfully big assumption, even in something as simple as sharing a link.
