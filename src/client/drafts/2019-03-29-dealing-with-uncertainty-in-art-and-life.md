title: Dealing With Uncertainty in Art...and Life

@TODO Note: This post stems from [my readings in “Art & Fear”]()

The author tells the story of a young student who began piano studies with a master. After a few months of practice, the student complained saying “I can hear the music so much better in my head than I can get out of my fingers”, to which the master replied “what makes you think that ever changes?”

The lesson? Uncertainty can be an asset in art. 

> vision is always ahead of execution — and it *should* be. Vision, uncertainty, and knowledge of materials are inevitabilities that all artists must acknowledge and learn from. (15)

Unfortunately, it seems everything you do is tainted by uncertainty: uncertainty of your materials, uncertainty around what you’re producing, and most of all, uncertainty about yourself and whether you’ll ever be satisfied with *anything* that you make. What’s important to remember (and why I loved this book) is the authors remind you: this is normal. 

> The truth is that the piece of art which seems so profoundly right in its finished state may earlier have been only inches or seconds away from total collapse...Art is like beginning a sentence before you know its ending. The risks are obvious: you may never get to the end of the sentence at all. (19)

The trick is that you need to give yourself room to react authentically. Many fiction writers don’t believe in making plot outlines because they’ve discovered that as the plot progresses, characters in the story take on a life of their own. So **control is not the domain of the artist, uncertainty is**. As the authors state, “tolerance for uncertainty is the prerequisite to succeeding”. 

What’s really interesting to me about these observation is that, while they were given in the context of art making, they are incredibly relevant to simply living life.
