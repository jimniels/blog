I recently redesigned my wordpress theme for [iOS Icon Gallery](http://iosicongallery.com) and [Mac Icon Gallery](http://macicongallery.com).

The old themes provided the ability to comment through the interface. Due to a lack of real comments and a surplus in spam comments, I decided to entirely remove the ability to comment from the interface.

## Removing the Ability to Comment From the Interface Is Not Enough to Keep Out Spam

Once my theme went live, I was still getting spam comments in the Wordpress backend. I asked myself, "how are comments still appearing in the Wordpress backend when I don't have a single comment form on my website?" After some Googling, I discovered this was due to spambots posting data directly using `wp-comments-post.php`.

## Further Stopping Spambots
To prevent spambots from posting to Wordpress via a URL, you can block access to `wp-comments-post.php` via the `.htaccess` file. Simply include these rules in your `.htaccess` file (thanks to [catswhocode](http://www.catswhocode.com/blog/snippets/blockreduce-wordpress-spam-comments-via-htaccess))

	<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
		RewriteEngine On
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} POST
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} .wp-comments-post.php*
		RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !.*yourdomainname.* [OR]
		RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^$
		RewriteRule (.*) ^http://%{REMOTE_ADDR}/$ [R=301,L]
	</IfModule>

**Note**: Be sure to change the `yourdomainname` part!
