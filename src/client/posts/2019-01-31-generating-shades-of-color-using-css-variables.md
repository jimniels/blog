title: Generating Shades of Color Using CSS Variables

Quite often I‚Äôve found myself using [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) (a.k.a. CSS variables) for working with color values (especially when [doing dark themes](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2018/icon-galleries-dark-mode/)). This is usually the type of CSS I‚Äôve written:

```css
:root {
  /* sometimes I use HEX colors */
  --color-text: #333;
  --color-highlight: #fb0000;

  /* sometimes I use RGB colors */
  --color-text: rgb(50, 50, 50);
  --color-highlight: rgb(251, 0, 0);
}

/* then use them like: */
.selector {
  color: var(--color-highlight);
}
```

My goal in working with colors on the web has been to define a limited, core color palette and then use lighter or darker shade variations of those core colors throughout my stylesheet. Problem is, those core colors are opaque and solid. So (turns out, erroneously) I always thought I‚Äôd have to create a large number of shade variants to have on hand when I need them, i.e.

```css
:root {
  --color-highlight: rgb(251, 0, 0);
  --color-highlight-9: rgba(251, 0, 0, .9);
  --color-highlight-8: rgba(251, 0, 0, .8);
  --color-highlight-7: rgba(251, 0, 0, .7);
  --color-highlight-6: rgba(251, 0, 0, .6);
  --color-highlight-5: rgba(251, 0, 0, .5);
  /* etc. */
}
```

This doesn‚Äôt feel good. Ten variants for every single core color? That could result in upwards of fifty color ‚Äúvariables‚Äù. Doesn‚Äôt feel much like a variable, does it? And what if I wanted an in-between value I hadn‚Äôt defined, like `rgba(251,0,0,.85)`?

When I used to write Sass, dealing with this problem was made relatively easy through Sass‚Äô `rgba()` function:

```scss
$color-highlight: #fb0000;

.selector {
  background-color: rgba($color-highlight, .5);
}
```

As you can see, I could hand a HEX value to the `rgba()` function and Sass would convert it to a set of `rgb` values, then spit it out in `rgba()` syntax with my specified opacity:

```css
.selector {
  color: rgba(251, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
```

This was incredibly useful because I could generate any shade of a core color I needed, depending on my contextual use case. The only problem is, I have to be using Sass. CSS can‚Äôt do that...or so I thought.

## How You Can‚Äôt

In my mind it seemed impossible to do something like: 

```css
:root {
  --color-highlight: #fb0000;
}

.selector {
  background-color: rgba(var(--color-highlight), .5);
}
```

And it is. At least how I‚Äôve outlined it above. And using `opacity` doesn‚Äôt work either, as it makes everything in the targeted element (and its children) transparent to a degree:

```css
:root {
  --color-highlight: #fb0000;
}

.selector {
  background-color: var(--color-highlight);
  opacity: .5;
}
```

One dirty workaround I used to leverage was to employ pseudo elements. Then I could, for example, position the pseudo element in the background of the main element, paint its background the color I want, then turn down the opacity (without affecting the main element or its children):

```css
:root {
  --color-highlight: #fb0000;
}

.selector {
  position: relative;
}
.selector::before {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
  background-color: var(--color-highlight);
  opacity: .5;
}
```

That worked, but only in a narrow, limited set of use cases. What I needed was something like Sass‚Äôs `rgba()` function, but with CSS variables.

Even if you defined the color variable as an rgb value, you still couldn‚Äôt intermix it with rgba, i.e.

```css
:root {
  --color-highlight: rgb(251,0.0);
}

.selector {
  /* doesn't work */
  background-color: rgba(var(--color-highlight), .5);
}
```

As you‚Äôre about to see (or if you already know the solution here), I was *sooooo* close to the solution I was looking for. I was never able to make that last mental leap to the correct syntax.

## How You Can

I don‚Äôt know if I was just being lazy, or faithless that what I wanted couldn‚Äôt be done, but I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs 2019 and only now am I discovering this little trick.

If you define your color values as a comma-separated list of rgb values, then you can do exactly what Sass‚Äôs `rgba()` function allows you to do:

```css
:root {
  --color-highlight: 251, 0, 0;
}

.selector {
  background-color: rgba(var(--color-highlight), .5);
}
```

It‚Äôs that simple. The worst part is, when I finally thought ‚Äúok, i‚Äôll go search Google and see if this is possible‚Äù, this insight was [the first result](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41265350/1339693).

What‚Äôs really neat about this too is that, if you *are* using Sass, you can leverage your color variables in Sass then pass them into your CSS output for usage there as well (FWIW, I wrote a little bit about [supporting CSS variables in Sass](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2018/supporting-css-variables-in-sass/)). 

In one particular use case of mine, this came in handy because at [Insight](https://www.icg360.com) we‚Äôre authoring a component library with a CSS framework but the source styles are actually written in Sass. Using this technique, we can define our theme color values in Sass, compile the styles to a CSS file, and empower consumers of our component library to leverage the same color variables we were using in Sass but via CSS. For example, in Sass:

```scss
// Color values
$color-highlight: #fb0000;
$color-secondary: #4caf50;

// Convert a hex value to comma-delimited rgb values
// In: #000
// Out: 0,0,0
@function derive-rgb-values-from-hex($hex) {
  @return red($hex), green($hex), blue($hex);
}

:root {
  // Brand colors as RGB values
  // This allows consumers to leverage opacity when working with colors, i.e.
  //   --my-var-name: 255, 161, 20;
  // Can be used like:
  //   background-color: rgba(var(--my-var-name), .5)
  --color-highlight: #{derive-rgb-values-from-hex($color-highlight)};
  --color-secondary: #{derive-rgb-values-from-hex($color-highlight)};
}
```

Consumers of our component library include our CSS in their app and then voil√†! They can have some or all of our Sass color variables available for use as they see fit in their own CSS files:

```css
.selector {
  background-color: rgba(var(--color-highlight), .5);
}
```

Pretty cool. Still can‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt figure this out until Jan 2019.

## Update Mar 27, 2019

[Tyler](https://tylergaw.com/) ([@thegaw](https://twitter.com/tylergaw)) pinged me on twitter and dropped this little note:

> I'm using your trick for using css custom prop for color + rgba. üëç working great, thanks! I'm finding myself setting a hex and rgb variables...That way I don't always have to use `rgba`, if I only need the hex value. Can just use `var()`

He dropped this code example to illustrate:

```css
--color-white: #fff;
--color-white-rgb: 255, 255, 255;
--color-text: #2f0664;
--color-text-rgb: 47, 6, 100;
```

This is a great tip! Since creating this post and using the approach I outlined, I found it tedious to constantly be declaring the color model syntax in addition to the color model values. For example:

```css
/* Given a variable of rgb values */
:root {
  --my-color-rgb: 255,255,255;
}
/* That gives me flexibility in working with the alpha channel */
.selector {
  color: rgba(var(--my-color), .25);
}
/* But to get the solid version of that color, I have to write this: */
.selector {
  color: rgba(var(--my-color), 1);
}
/* Or this */
.selector {
  color: rgb(var(--my-color))
}
```

As you can see, I declare a solid color for my variable, but I have to wrap it in the `rgb` or `rgba` syntax to use it‚Äîopacity or no opacity. Kind of a bummer. So Tyler‚Äôs suggestion is spot on with real-world use.

I think the reason I probably avoided this approach mentally is because I did‚Äôt like mixing HEX and RGB color value declarations. I‚Äôm not a machine and can‚Äôt do the translation of RGB to HEX in my brain. Imagine coming into a codebase anew and seeing:

```css
--color-text: #2f0664;
--color-text-rgb: 47, 6, 100;
```

How would you know that those are actually the same color, just expressed in the syntax of different color models? It‚Äôs probably safe to assume they are the same colors, but the ambiguity is there. Obviously you could just add a comment. Or you could also use `rgb` instead of `hex`.

```css
--color-text: rgb(47, 6, 100);
--color-text-rgb: 47, 6, 100;
```

I think that makes it a little more obvious what‚Äôs going on. With that said, I started writing my colors on the web in HEX, so I‚Äôm much more fluent understanding what a color is by seeing it in HEX vs. RGB, so I may still end up rolling with Tyler‚Äôs suggestion.
