My latest tutorial teachs how to build a responsive, single page portfolio with Sass and Compass.

The tutorial incorporates modern web development techniques such as:

- Responsive design
- HTML5
- CSS using Sass and Compass
- Typography via Google's Web Fonts service
- API calls using jQuery
- Pure CSS horizontally-scrolling carousel supporting touch interactions
- HiDPI support via icon font usage

You have to be a premium subscriber to see the entire tutorial.
