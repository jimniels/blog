![Everything You Need to Know about the CSS Cursor Rule via Webdesign Tuts+][1]

A preview of my most recent article over at Webdesign Tuts:

Touch-based interaction devices are the hot topic these days. I hate to burst anyone's bubble but traditional input methods, like the mouse, aren't going away anytime soon.

This article will provide you with everything you need to know about using the `cursor` rule in CSS. Although touch input methods are here to stay, the `cursor` rule is still very relevant in designing interfaces on the web.

Because the nature of the web demands universality and accessibility, hybrid interfaces that support both touch and traditional input methods are increasingly necessary. Tactful implementation of the CSS `cursor` rule in design interaction can be a powerful feature of progressive enhancement.

Also, don't miss the end of the tutorial where I provide a comprehensive visual breakdown of cursor values across devices and platforms.
