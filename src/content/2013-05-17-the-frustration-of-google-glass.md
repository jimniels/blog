[Here's a video](http://www.youtube.com/embed/S80mE3kQTJ0) showcasing the potential of Google Glass.

All I could see in this video is Google Glass' potential for frustration. My experience in paying for a coffee would most likely go something like this:



**Me**: [*me paying for coffee, speaking to glass*] Ok glass, pay for coffee, use my credit card  
**Glass**: Using debit card ending in 4516  
**Me**: No glass, I said *credit* card  
**Glass**: Which credit card would you like to use?  
**Me**: My American Express  
**Glass**: Which American Express would you like to use?  
**Me**: My gold card  
**Glass**: Error. Sorry, you don't have a "gold" American Express card. Valid types are cards ending in: 4512 and 7483  
**Me**: I don't know, use the card ending in 4512  
**Glass**: Processing … transaction cancelled. Trying again … it appears you don't have any money on this card. Trying American Express card ending in 7483 … processing  
**Me**: [*speaking to cashier*] Sorry, it will just take another second, my card isn't going through. I always have trouble with that card. American Express always stops transactions on it, I wonder if it's beca...  
**Glass**: Stopping transaction...  
**Me**: No Glass! I wasn't talking to you. Keep using that card.  
**Glass**: Transaction stopped. What would you like to do now?  
**Me**: Ok Glass, let's try this again. Pay for coffee.  
**Glass**: You don't have any valid credit cards, but you can add a new one. What's the number?  
**Me**: I don't' want to say my credit card number out loud.  
**Glass**: Error. What do you want to do now?  
**Me**: Damnit glass. Ok pay for coffee. Use PayPal  
**Glass**: Password please?  
**Me**: Damnit I can't say my password here in front of everyone!  
**Glass**: Password please?  
**Me**: Ugh, damn you glass.  
**Me**: [*speaking to cashier*] I'm sorry, I'm going to have to just not get this coffee  
**Me**: [*walking out the door, speaking to glass*] How much does a used Google Glass go for on eBay?  
**Glass**: Searching Google for used glass gophers on eBay
