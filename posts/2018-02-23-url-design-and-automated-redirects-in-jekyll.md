# URL Design and Automated Redirects in Jekyll

## The Problem: Poor URL Design

Confession: when I initially setup my [icon](http://iosicongallery.com/) [gallery](http://macosicongallery.com/) [sites](http://watchosicongallery.com/), I did’t really know what I was doing. I knew I had to have URLs for each icon, so I merely copied what I saw lots of other blogs doing those days. I setup my URL structure like so:

`/:category/:slug/`

Which, for an app’s icon, resulted in URLs like this:

`/social-networking/facebook/`

At a later point in time (which I believe coincided me switching the underlying technology powering the site—from Wordpress to Jekyll) I changed my URL structure to this new pattern:

`/:year/:slug`

Which, for an app’s icon, resulted in URLs like this:

`/2015/facebook`

At the time, I think part of my reasoning for these changes stemmed from my original (poor) choice to include the app’s category in the post URL.

1. Categories weren’t that important to the information architecture of the site
2. Categories were subject to change by Apple (Apple uses IDs in their API for categories, therefore they can easily change the name of a category from say “Social Networking” to “Social Networks” without a change to the underlying category ID).

Furthermore, after having posted icons for a couple years, I found myself in the situation where I was posting multiple icons for the same application. For example, Twitter had one icon in 2012 that I posted to my gallery. Then, with the popularization of “flat design”, Twitter changed their app’s icon in 2014 and I wanted to also post that icon to my gallery. But I already had an icon posted at `/social-networking/twitter`. This taught me that the date the icon was posted to the gallery had meaning in the information architecture of my site. Looking back, I *believe* that’s why I decided to change the URL structure to be inclusive of date (`/:year/:slug`). At the time, I probably thought “there’s no way I’ll ever need to post an icon from an app more than once a year”. I don’t know if I actually thought that, but if I did, I wasn’t very ~~smart~~ experienced.

I’m foreshadowing here, but this decision came back to haunt me because this particular URL design dictated that I could only post one icon per app per year. For example, if I posted the icon for [Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/) in, say, January of 2017, the URL to that post would look like this:

`/2017/tweetbot`

Then, if Tweetbot released a new icon in, say, October of 2017 and I wanted to post it to my site, I would have two icon posts competing for the url `/2017/tweetbot`. The only way to get around this limitation would be:

1. Wait until the next year to post the icon (which is obviously a ridiculous limitation)
2. Give the icon a new, unique slug (something that really shows I know how to use computers, like `/2017/tweetbot-2`)

This wasn’t an issue I ran into all the time, but I did run into it frequently enough for it to irritate me. So I decided to finally do something about it and change all my URLs so that I could post any icon at any point in time.

## The Solution: More Thoughtful URL Design

I began by thinking about what I wanted my new URLs to look like. At first I thought about using just a seemingly cryptic ID of some kind, like `/192810394`, because then I’d never have to change URLs again (as my IDs would never change). But there were two problems with that approach:

1. I liked the idea of having URLs that conveyed meaning to human beings. `iosicongallery.com/192810394` means nothing to a human other than “looks like content of some kind lives at that URL”.
2. My site was powered by Jekyll which doesn’t support automatically generating unique, immutable IDs on a per-post basis. At the time of writing this blog post, Jekyll doesn’t do that out of the box. You’d have to manually assign an ID to each post in the YAML front matter. Alternatively, you could conceivably create a URL for each post that looks like an ID by doing permalinks based on the post date, i.e. `/:year:month:day:hour:minute:second`. That would not have worked for me, however, because all my posts dating back 5+ years only have date precision down to the day. If I followed a permalink format like that, I’d get URL collisions for any posts from the same day. For example, three different posts from January 14, 2017, for me would result in `/20170114000000` (as I didn’t set hours, minutes or seconds for previous posts).

I decided to work within the constraints of what was provided by [jekyll permalinks](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/). A post’s slug (i.e. `angry-birds`) on its own wouldn’t be enough to serve as a unique identifier. I realized the post’s *full* date was the extra piece of information I needed to provide a meaningful and unique identifier for all icons in my galleries.

At first I thought about keeping the same date format I already had in my sites’ URLs (i.e. `/:year/:slug`). I would just need to use the fully-qualified date to help alleviate myself of any potential issues with URL collision. For example:

`iosicongallery.com/2017-07-11/logic-remote`

But at the end of the day, I did’t want to support index listings at the date level. For example, under the format above, if the user hit `.../2017-07-11/` a semantically-responsible site would return all posts from that date. I didn’t want to support this kind of querying via URLs. Plus, writing that kind of static file structure wasn’t even something Jekyll supported anyway.

So I decided a good URL structure would be to have all posts live directly off the root, identified solely by a unique ID consisting of a combination of the post date and the app’s slug. This led me to try a few variations of `/:date-:slug` and `/:slug-:date`:

- `iosicongallery.com/2017-07-11-logic-remote`
- `iosicongallery.com/logic-remote-2017-07-11`

In the above examples, I liked the left-to-right reading that identified the post’s slug first and date second, as the name of the app was the piece of information that would resonate with humans most. So, going down that path, I made sure all subsequent contenders for a new URL format follow that pattern. 

(Side note: for what it’s worth, I basically did what you’re seeing me do here which is write out all possible options in a single text file and then compare them, weeding out possible contenders based on how they made me feel or what logical arguments my brain came up with around URL design.)

Anyway, I knew I wanted a pattern that read slug first, date second. Now I just had to figure out what format I wanted my dates to take.

- `iosicongallery.com/logic-remote-2017-07-11`
- `iosicongallery.com/logic-remote-17-07-11`

I didn’t like how the dates read when separated by hyphens in combination with the application slug. It made the URL read very long while also making the slug  feel like it had equal weight with the date. So I tried this:

- `iosicongallery.com/logic-remote-20170711`
- `iosicongallery.com/logic-remote-170711`

Indicating the date as a single unit of text with no dividing hyphens felt like a more natural division (yet simultaneously a unification) of information. To me, this made the URL more parseable and readable as a human being. The date part of the URL feels like “this exists as one of those computer ID things”. However, if you looked closer you can discern the information encoded within: a date. This felt like the right balance in terms of a human brain parsing the URL and the computer needing unique IDs on a post-by-post basis. The date reads more inconsequential than the slug yet it remains parseable by humans. It’s readable, but not on the same level of readability as the hyphenated slug. The more relevant information to the casual human parsing the link is the slug and it stands out over the date which fades into the background (yet remains discernible). The more familiar you become with the site, the more easily you’d recognize this  pattern in the URLs, which really is the only point in time I think that piece of information starts becoming important to you. This made it feel like the right design.

With that justification in mind, I weighed my last two options:

- `iosicongallery.com/logic-remote-20170711`
- `iosicongallery.com/logic-remote-170711`

Excluding the year prefix makes the date a little more cryptic as you almost just intake the number. I liked the idea of keeping the “20” prefix for two reason:

1. It was more discernible and discoverable as a date by humans.
2. My posts would be unique for the next thousands of years and not just till the end of the current century. Granted that’s a little ridiculous and hard to justify, but more and more I like to think of [the long game of the web](https://adactio.com/articles/1522). I’d like to think in the year 2156 you could still post and browse the site :)

After coming to a conclusion about what I felt was best, I let it sit for a few days. I stopped thinking about my decision and forgot all my reasoning around it. Then, after probably a week or so, I came back to my decision with fresh eyes (FWIW: this is one of my favorite problem solving techniques). Coming back with fresh eyes and a mind disassociated from the problem allows me to have a more impactful gut reaction to know if I’ve arrived at a good decision. When I came back after a few days, my gut felt I’d made a good decision. So I stuck with this format:

`iosicongallery.com/logic-remote-20170711`

I liked this format because the human friendly slug touches the right balance with the slightly obscured yet still discernible date. It was a good balance in readability between the two pieces of the information encoded in the URL: 1) the name of the app and 2) the date the icon was posted. I knew I’d never post the same application icon on the same day, so this design choice was enough to ensure every post going forward would be unique.

I know, this all sounds like a lot of fretting over minutia, but I really wanted to get the URLs right because I don’t ever want to redo them again. As a recovering perpetrator of link rot, I try to do everything I can these days to preserve my URLs for time and all eternity. Which leads me to the second part of this post: how I automated writing over a thousand redirects into static Jekyll markdown posts.

## The How: Writing Lots of Redirects for Jekyll Posts

In order to prevent link rot, I vowed to setup proper redirects for all my existing posts. The constraints of my site dictated I use Jekyll for doing redirects, as I didn’t have a server-side aspect to the site where I could do some kind of pattern-matching redirects. Instead, my sole option was [`jekyll-redirect-from`](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from) which is the official, Github pages supported option for creating redirects in Jekyll. `jekyll-redirect-from` works by creating “an HTML file with an HTTP-REFRESH meta tag which points to your destination”.

I was actually already using `jekyll-redirect-from` in my site from the last time I changed the URLs. Many of my posts from 2012 and 2013 were initially hosted on the web at URLs following a pattern of `/:category/:slug`. When I changed to `/:year/:slug` I had to create redirects for those posts. So some of my posts were already leveraging `redirect_from` in their YAML front-matter, i.e.

```yaml
title: Angry Birds
slug: angry-birds
redirect_from: /games/angry-birds/
```

Since I decided to change my URLs from their current structure of `/:year/:slug`, I had to ensure that every existing markdown file had at least one redirect (`/:year/:slug` -> `/:slug-:date/`). Plus, as mentioned above, I also needed to accommodate some of my posts having two redirects.

### What I Needed Done

At first (perhaps naively) I thought I could leverage a find/replace regex through my editor to add a `redirect_from` to each posts’ front-matter, but I quickly realized the changes I needed to make were more significant. Some quick pseudo code illustrated that I needed some kind of custom automation script to loop through every post and do a couple things for each one.

#### Redirects

Some of my posts already had a `redirect_from` value in the front-matter (which was in the form of a single value). For these posts, I would now need multiple values representing multiple redirects. For example:

```yaml
# 2011-01-12-angry-birds.md

# Exisiting `redirect_from` value:
redirect_from: /games/angry-birds

# Desired `redirect_from` value:
redirect_from:
  - /games/angry-birds/
  - /2011/angry-birds
```

For posts that didn’t yet have a `redirect_from` value, I could just add it to the post:

```yaml
# 2017-02-03-tweetbot.md

# Desired `redirect_from` value:
redirect_from:
  - /2017/tweetbot
```

So essentially I needed my script to detect: does this already have a `redirect_from` value? If so, turn it into an array of values and add the new redirect to it. Otherwise, just add a new `redirect_from` value with the new redirect (as an array, in case we ever need to add more in the future).

My scripts needed to read through each post file line by line, because I didn’t have any assurances about where in the file a `redirect_from` value might be found. It could be the first piece of metadata in the file, the last, or somewhere in between. Thus, my script read through each post line by line and when it found a `redirect_from`, it stored it in memory and rewrote it at the very end of the YAML front-matter. If no `redirect_from` value was found, then I wrote the new redirect at the end.

#### Icon Images

Each post had corresponding icons image files matching their URL (i.e. a `slug-date.png` pattern resulted in an icon image like `angry-birds-2017.png`) which meant I was running into the same naming collision problem with the URLs over time. To fix this, I needed my pattern for naming icons image files for a post to match the URL.

Because my automated script was already looping through each post, I had each posts’ metadata available to me. This allowed me to put together all the pieces of information from the post which I needed for the new filename pattern I decided on: `:slug-:year-:month-:day.png`. Additionally, I had various sizes for each icon in a respective folder, so I had to do a rename for all icon sizes, i.e.

- `icons/512/facebook-2017.png` -> `icons/512/facebook-02-24-2017.png`
- `icons/256/facebook-2017.png` -> `icons/256/facebook-02-24-2017.png`
- `icons/128/facebook-2017.png` -> `icons/128/facebook-02-24-2017.png`
- etc.


### The Actual Script

If you’d like to read through the specifics of my node script, I’ve got it here in all its glory for your reading pleasure (along with some comments to better help describe what’s going on).

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

// Setup my paths
const baseDir = path.join(__dirname, '../../');
const postsDir = path.join(baseDir, '_posts');
const imgsDir = path.join(baseDir, 'img');

// Loop over each post .md file and do some stuff
fs.readdirSync(postsDir)
  // Filter out any files that aren't a post .md file
  .filter(filename => filename.endsWith('.md'))
  .forEach(filename => {
    
    // String accumulator for the new file i'm going to write
    let fileout = "";

    // Each piece of information is on it's own line, so put each line of the
    // the file into an array.
    const lines = fs.readFileSync(path.join(postsDir, filename)).toString().split('\n');

    // Pull out any values i'll need for later
    const date = lines.filter(line => line.startsWith('date:'))[0].split(':')[1].trim();
    const dateYear = (new Date(date)).getFullYear();
    const slug = lines.filter(line => line.startsWith('slug:'))[0].split(':')[1].trim();

    // Format each redirect will take, i.e. /2017/facebook
    // Storing these in an array because we might have more than one redirect
    // to write to the file.
    let redirect = [`/${dateYear}/${slug}`];
    
    lines.forEach((line, i) => {
      // If it's the last line of the file, do nothing
      if (line === "" && i === lines.length - 1) {
        return;
      }

      // If it has a redirect, store it, then skip writing out this line
      // as we'll write it out later when we're at the end of the front-matter
      if (line.startsWith('redirect_from:')) {
        redirect.unshift(line.split(':')[1].trim());
        return;
      }

      // If last line of front-matter, write the redirect, otherwise just
      // write the normal content of the line.
      if (line === "---" && i !== 0) {
        fileout += `redirect_from:\n${redirect.map(r => `  - ${r}\n`).join('')}---\n`;
      } else {
        fileout += line + "\n";
      }
    });

    // We've looped over every line in the file and concatenated our new file
    // So just write out the new changes to the .md file
    fs.writeFileSync(path.join(postsDirTarget, filename), fileout);

    // Now find all the icons associated with this post and rename them
    // to have the full date, i.e.
    // "facebook-2017.png" -> "facebook-2017-01-20.png"
    ['128', '256', '512', '1024'].forEach(size => {
      const oldImgName = slug + "-" + dateYear + '.png';
      const oldImgPath = path.join(imgsDir, size, oldImgName);
      
      if (fs.existsSync(oldImgPath)) {
        const newImgName = slug + "-" + date + '.png';
        const newImgPath = path.join(imgsDir, size, newImgName);
        fs.renameSync(oldImgPath, newImgPath);
      }
    });
});
```

## The End

I ran my script on all three of my gallery sites and it worked perfect on each one (granted not the first time). Git made this process *extremely* easy, as I could run my script as many times as I wanted. Each time through it would manipulate files and then I could preview the differences using Git. If something wasn’t as I expected, I could just re-checkout every file in Git (`git checkout -- .`), modify my script, and then try running it again. I did this however many times it took until it was rewriting my files as I expected. Using Git like this made the whole process incredibly easy. In the old days before Git, I could’ve seen myself doing a copy/paste of my entire project, running the node script on the file copies, and if the changes went awry, deleting the copied files and then trying again. It would’ve been a lot of copy pasting. And even when I though the script was running perfectly, I would’ve still created a copy of the original project and stored it somewhere just in case when I deployed the changes via FTP and found something wrong, I’d still have a backup. So what I learned from this process is:

1. Git is awesome.
2. URLs are UI and should be [thoughtfully designed](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI) at the beginning of a project.
