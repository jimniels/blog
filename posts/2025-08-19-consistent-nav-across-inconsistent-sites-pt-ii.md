# Consistent Navigation Across My Inconsistent Websites, Part II

I refreshed the little thing that let‚Äôs you [navigate consistently between my inconsistent subdomains](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/consistent-nav-across-inconsistent-sites/) ([video recording](https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-video.mp4)).

Here‚Äôs the tl;dr on the update:

- I had to remove some features on each site to make this feel right.
	- Takeaway: adding stuff is easy, removing stuff is hard.
- The element is a web component and not even under source control (ü§´). I serve it directly from [my cdn](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2019/netlify-public-folder-part-i-what/). If I want to make an update, I tweak the file on disk and [re-deploy](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/deploying-with-netlify-shortcuts/).
	- Takeaway: cowboy codin‚Äô, yee-haw! Live free and die hard.
- So. Many. Iterations. All of which led to what? A small, iterative evolution. 
	- Takeaway: it‚Äôs ok for design explorations to culminate in updates that look more like an evolution than a mutation.

## Design Explorations

It might look like a simple iteration on what I previously had, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I didn‚Äôt explore the universe of possibilities first before coming back to the current iteration.

### v0: Tabs!

A tab-like experience seemed the most natural, but how to represent it? I tried a few different ideas. On top. On bottom. Different visual styles, etc.

And of course, gotta explore how that plays out on desktop too.

Some I liked, some I didn‚Äôt. As much as I wanted to play with going to the edges of the viewport, I realized that every browser is different and you won't be able to get a consistent ‚Äúbleed-like‚Äù visual experience across browsers. For example, if you try to make tabs that bleed to the edges, it looks nice in a frame in Figma, and even in some browsers. But it won‚Äôt look right in all browser, like iOS Safari.

<img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v0-tabs.png" width="1348" height="550" alt="Mobile UI mockups showing a folder-style segmented tab control. One is in the frame of an iPhone where the control bleeds up into the restricted space where the dynamic island lives as well as down into the website. Whereas the other mockup is in a frame in Figma, so the highlighted tab only bleeds down into the website." />

So I couldn‚Äôt reliably leverage the idea of a bounded canvas as a design element ‚Äî which, I should‚Äôve known, has always been the case with the web.

### v1: Bottom Tabs With a Site Theme

I really like this pattern on mobile devices, so I thought maybe I‚Äôd consider it for navigating between my sites.

But how to theme across differently-styled sites? The favicon styles seemed like a good bet!

And, of course, what do to on larger devices? Just stacking it felt like overkill, so I explored moving it to the edge.

I actually prototyped this in code, but I didn‚Äôt like how it felt so I scratched the idea and went other directions.

## v2: The Unification

The more I explored what to do with this element, the more it started taking on additional responsibility.

‚ÄúWhat if I unified its position _with_ site-specific navigation?‚Äù I thought.

This led to design explorations where the disparate subdomains began to take on not just a unified navigational element, but a unified header.

And I made small, stylistic explorations with the tabs themselves too.

You can see how I played toyed with the idea of a consistent header across all my sites (not an intended goal, but ya know, scope creep gets us all).

As I began to explore more possibilities than I planned for, things started to get out of hand.

## v3: Do More. MORE. MORE!!

Questions I began asking:

- Why aren‚Äôt these all under the same domain?!
- What if I had a single domain for feeds across all of them, e.g. `feeds.jim-nielsen.com`?
- What about icons instead of words?

Wait, wait, wait Jim. Consistent navigation across inconsistent sites. That‚Äôs the goal. Pare it back a little.

## v4: Reigning It Back In

To counter my exploratory ambitions, I told myself I needed to ship something without the need to modify the entire design style of all my sites.

So how do I do that?

That got me back to a simpler premise: consistent navigation across my inconsistent sites.

<img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v4.png" width="1070" height="768" alt="Dynamic-island-like navigational pill for the subdomains on www, blog, and notes subdomains of jim-nielsen.com" />

Better ‚Äî and implementable.

## Technical Details

The implementation was pretty simple. I basically just forked my previous web component and changed some styles. That‚Äôs it.

The only thing I did different was I moved the web component JS file from being part of my `www.jim-nielsen.com` git repository to a standalone file (not under git control) on my CDN.

This felt like one of the exceptions to the rule of always keeping stuff under version control. It‚Äôs more of the classic FTP-style approach to web development. Granted, it‚Äôs riskier, but it‚Äôs also way more flexible. And I‚Äôm good with that trade-off for now. (Ask me again in a few months if I‚Äôve done anything terrible and now have regrets.)

Each site implements the component like this (with a different `subdomain` attribute for each site):

```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/shared/jim-site-switcher.js"></script>
<jim-site-switcher subdomain="blog"></jim-site-switcher>
```

That‚Äôs really all there is to say. Thanks to Zach for [prodding me to make this post](https://fediverse.zachleat.com/@zachleat/114942811780696272).
