# “The macOS App Icon Book” IRL

Guess what I received in the mail today?

You likely guessed it from the title, but I’ll say it anyway: _The macOS App Icon Book_.

(If you didn’t catch it, [I’ve written previously](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/tags/#iconGalleriesBook) about my contribution to its prequel.)

This one [got funded on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flarup/the-macos-app-icon-book) a few months back and, fast-forward to today, it’s now a real-to-goodness physical book!

I am not a product photographer — I’ll leave that work to others — but it’s beautiful and I love it.

With this book, its prequel, and [the prequel’s Japanese edition](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/japanese-ios-app-icon-book/), I now own the suite — like Pokemon, I’ve caught them all.
