[Jeremy imagines a scenario](https://adactio.com/journal/22183) where you’re trying to understand how someone cut themselves with a blade. It’d be hard to know how they cut themselves just by looking at the wound.

> But if you talk to the person, not only will you find out the reason, you’ll also understand their pain.

But what if, hear me out here, instead we manufactured tiny microchips with sensors and embedded them in all blades?

Then we program them such that if they break human flesh, we send data — time, location, puncture depth, current blade sharpness, etc. — back to our servers for processing with AI.

This data will help us understand — without bias, because humans can’t be trusted — how people cut themselves. 

Thus our research scales much more dramatically than talking to individual humans, widening our impact on humanity whilst simultaneously improving our product  (and bottom line)!
