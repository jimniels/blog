# Favorite Excerpts from the Postlight Podcast, Part II

I’ve written previously about how much I enjoy the Rich/Paul combination of the Postlight Podcast and [highlighted some of my favorite excerpts](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2021/fav-excerpts-from-the-postlight-podcast/). Now I have more.

Given that [Postlight was acquired](https://postlight.com/insights/an-exciting-next-chapter-postlight-joins-ntt-data), I’m unsure of the  podcast’s future and whether there will be a “Part III” to this series. So I’m taking this moment to document the gems we’ve been bequeathed up to now.

## [Ep. 268](https://postlight.com/podcast/no-ai-needed-fix-the-old-before-bringing-in-the-new)

> [Rich]: [an “AI engine”] is just regular expressions.
> 
> [Paul]: If you want to charge more for statistics, just call it machine learning.

## [Ep. 270](https://postlight.com/podcast/internal-startups-why-you-should-proceed-with-caution)

> [Rich]: People who are enamored with technology and just love the magic of tech have to be very, very careful because the real decision makers don’t give a shit. 
> 
> [Paul]: They really don’t and that’s not bad. That’s just what’s up.

## [Ep. 279](https://postlight.com/podcast/alternate-reality-what-we-would-have-done-differently)

> [Paul]: There are so many people who just want to take your money and will give you a dashboard in return.

## [Ep. 280](https://postlight.com/podcast/facebooks-oversight-board-on-policing-the-platform)

Rich commenting on the eerily-similar character attributes he notices between cult leaders in Netflix documentaries and Silicon Valley startup leaders:

> [Rich]: If [a cult leader] was interested in mobile apps, they would [be] a billionaire.

## [Ep. 289](https://postlight.com/podcast/how-to-talk-to-billionaires)

> [Paul]: Ultra high net worth individuals or extremely powerful individuals are unbelievably good at taking your time and really not giving you a lot in return.

> [Paul]: [Rich people are] not going to give you $2 million because you had a fun idea. [Or if they are] they’re going to take 35% of your company.

> [Rich]: Don’t seek [rich people’s] love. They died after the first $200 million. They just died. And then they kept building houses and yachts.

## [Ep. 291](https://postlight.com/podcast/transferring-motivation-on-creating-the-space-to-get-things-done)

> [Paul]: You’re always one project away from happiness.

## [Ep. 296](https://postlight.com/podcast/on-managing-your-aws-bills-with-corey-quinn)

> [Corey Quinn]: The theory of cloud computing is that you only pay for what you use; in practice you pay for what you forget to turn off. 

## [Ep. 308](https://postlight.com/podcast/a-constellation-of-tools-how-we-work-today)

> [Paul]: Are our employees happy and motivated to stay?…the office is an attractive, good place to be, where it's easy to get work done. It’s a warm environment. Good coffee. Not super spoiled, there’s no ball pit or anything.

## [Ep. 316](https://postlight.com/podcast/on-web3-again-this-time-with-michael-sippey)

> [Guest]: DAOs are essentially subreddits with bank accounts and governance, right? 
> 
> [Paul]: That sounds like a great way to build a society.

# [Ep. 318](https://postlight.com/podcast/data-as-a-language-with-postlights-reed-whitmont)

> [Paul]: You know why leaders love data? Because it’s not their decision. 

## [Ep. 327](https://postlight.com/podcast/theres-no-escape-from-physical-reality-why-web-3-is-boring)

> [Paul]: people do need to get close enough to [crypto, NFTs, etc.], but I just don’t buy any of it. I want them to all go invest in Vanguard fund and just get incremental returns on the S&P 500 as opposed to messing around with magical monkey pictures.

## [Ep. 330](https://postlight.com/podcast/vanity-purchases-on-elon-musk-and-twitter)

> [Paul]: The difference between billionaires and everybody else is that when billionaires think about dying, they’re pretty sure they should do something about it…[They think] “I have created value for a tremendous number of shareholders. And now I’m looking at mortality. Nobody expected for financial transactions to cost pennies and be able to talk across multiple bank systems. So maybe [I] should be looking at cellular degeneration.”

> [Paul]: Musk is talking about all this unlocked, untouched value, right? My instinct is…Twitter is essentially a war of attrition. It’s World War I trench warfare as a social media company. Yeah, you might be able to move one or two inches in one way or the other, but everybody dies.
