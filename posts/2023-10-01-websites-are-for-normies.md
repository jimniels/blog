# Making a Website is for Everyone

[Dave asked](https://indieweb.social/@davatron5000@mastodon.social/110912189285291743) what makes people excited about building for the web and [Thomas answered](https://indieweb.social/@nachtfunke/110912228740815266) with this wonderful articulation:

> the web is the only programming platform (that I know of) that considers its builders regular people, not IT Professionals and continues to write standards with that consideration.

Love this.

I made my first website as a young teenager because the barrier was so low (and I dropped out of my very first computer science course _after the very first class_ because the barrier seemed so high).

I realize complexity enters the scene because the web is _world wide_. There are so many people trying to do so many things with it, that it has to be wide and deep to accommodate all those use cases.

But I absolutely _love_ the idea of actively preserving a low barrier to entry for future generations of people. 

“Would teenage Jim have been able make a website now-a-days?” That’s the question I ask myself every time I write a blog post about new technique X or tool Y.

Over time, the direction of web technology always trends towards complexity. Simplicity is achieved as a concerted, mindful fight against this.

The web’s low barrier to entry led me to a career that has been a boon for my life. I hope it can do the same for others.
