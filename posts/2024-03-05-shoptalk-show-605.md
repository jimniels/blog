# My Guest Appearance on ShopTalk Show #605

Here’s the link: https://shoptalkshow.com/605/

I sat down ([again](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/me-on-shoptalkshow-504/)) with Chris and Dave to talk all things web.

The conversation was fun and casual, mostly around topics I’ve written about recently — which is good, since those are topics I should (presumably) be able to speak on at least somewhat knowledgeably.

Big thanks to Chris and Dave for having me on the show! 

After recording, I actually started to think more about this idea of “mouth-blogging”. And, should they ever decide to have me back on the show, here’s my pitch to Chris and Dave for the next episode (or, really, any episode with a future guest):

- We reach into our list of blog post drafts.
- We pull out a couple drafts — maybe the oldest ones by date? — that we know we’ll never publish but haven’t had the heart to delete.
- We mouth-blog them on the show.
- We then either 1) feel encouraged to finish the draft and publish it, or 2) cathartically delete the draft permanently, knowing we got out what we wanted to say.

Until then, go check out [episode 605](https://shoptalkshow.com/605/).
