# Becoming an Asshole

I’ve been reading [_Apple in China_](https://bookshop.org/p/books/apple-in-china-the-capture-of-the-world-s-greatest-company-patrick-mcgee/21872828) by Patrick McGee.

There’s this part in there where he’s talking about a guy who worked for Apple and was known for being ruthless, stopping at nothing to negotiate the best deal for Apple. He was so aggressive yet convincing that suppliers often found themselves faced with regret, wondering how they got talked into a deal that in hindsight was _not_ in their best interest.[^1]

One particular Apple executive sourced in the book noted how there are companies who don’t employ questionable tactics to gain an edge, but most of them don’t exist anymore. To paraphrase: “I worked with two kinds of suppliers at Apple: 1) complete assholes, and 2) those who are no longer in business.”

Taking advantage of people is normalized in business on account of it being existential, i.e. “If we don’t act like assholes — or have someone on our team who will on our behalf[^1] — we will not survive!” In other words: All’s fair in self-defense.

But what’s the point of survival if _you_ become an asshole in the process? 

What else is there in life if not _what you become_ in the process? 

It’s almost comedically twisted how easy it is for us to become the very thing we abhor if it means our survival. 

(Note to self: before you start anything, ask “What will this help me become, and is that who I want to be?”)

[^1]: It’s interesting how we can smile at stories like that and think, “Gosh they’re tenacious, glad they’re on my side!” Not stopping to think for a moment what it would feel like to be on the other side of that equation.
