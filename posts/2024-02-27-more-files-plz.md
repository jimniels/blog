# More Files Please

Scott Jenson has a great article called [“The future needs files”](https://jenson.org/files/).

> The power of files comes from them being powerful nouns. They are temporary holding blocks that are used as a form of exchange between applications. A range of apps can edit a single file in a single location.

Files as a medium of exchange between applications — I like that. It’s akin to the usefulness of currency.

> The most powerful aspect of files is that they liberate your data. Any app can see it and do something useful to it.

Files represent a “data first vs app first organization”. If you’re planning a wedding, you put everything wedding related into a folder. All your data is now in one place vs. strewn across various apps.

Documents — like a Notion doc — are today’s folders: they contain a list of links to “files” that will open in bespoke applications. 

But there are drawbacks, like interoperability. Do we want to trust our data to the success or failure of a single company?

> Files encapsulate a ‘chunk’ of your work and allow that chunk to be seen, moved, acted on, and accessed by multiple people and more importantly external 3rd party processes.

Can you imagine working on a codebase — which is  a set of files — but the files were locked to a particular IDE? Craziness.

Personally, I’m a file guy. I love files. And I wish more products worked in the currency of exchange of files.
