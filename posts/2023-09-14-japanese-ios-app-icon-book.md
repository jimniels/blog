# “The iOS App Icon Book” in Japanese

Seeing something you made put in print is exciting.

Seeing something you made _translated_ and put in print, well that’s pretty damn exciting too.

Such was the feeling when I opened my copy of the Japanese translation of _The iOS App Icon Book_.

While the core idea of the book transcends language — visual artwork requires no translation — there’s a lot of words in the book too. And some of them are mine.

Like the chapter “A Short History of iOS App Icons” (which [I’ve also published on my blog](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/short-history-of-ios-app-icons/)). It has my name right there on the chapter heading.

Apparently “Jim Nielsen” is written as “ジム・ニールセン”. Fun!

And seeing the content of the chapter (my own writing) translated to Japanese is kind of surreal.

I don’t know who did the translation, but whoever you are, thank you!

Oh, and there’s a nod to my site [iOS Icon Gallery](https://www.iosicongallery.com) at the back of the book.

The book is [available on Amazon](https://www.amazon.sg/iOS%E3%82%A2%E3%83%97%E3%83%AA%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%82%B3%E3%83%B3%E5%9B%B3%E9%91%91-%E3%83%9B%E3%83%93%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A3%E3%83%91%E3%83%B3%E3%81%AE%E6%8A%80%E6%B3%95%E6%9B%B8-%E3%83%9E%E3%82%A4%E3%82%B1%E3%83%AB%E3%83%BB%E3%83%95%E3%83%A9%E3%83%AB%E3%83%83%E3%83%97/dp/4798629480) if you’re interested.

(Oh, and if you’ve seen it already, there’s a new app icon book that just launched [on Kickstarter: “The macOS App Icon Book”](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flarup/the-macos-app-icon-book) — that one is in English.)
