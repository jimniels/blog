# What’s It Worth?

> How much is CI stability worth? Or community happiness? – [@kantrn](https://twitter.com/kantrn/status/1511791402845310977)

What’s the value of something that can’t be wholly measured? How can it be justified in a world that equates measurement with existence?

What’s love worth? How do you measure it? Do you enumerate the pronunciations of “I love you” over time to demonstrate an upward trend line?

I love the web, but how did we come to measuring, monetizing, and extracting the value of its every transaction? A digital manifest destiny.

I love a web that remains unmeasured, whose value remains unascertained, and whose essence remains [“vague but exciting”](http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html).
