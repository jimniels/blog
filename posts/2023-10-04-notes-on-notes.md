# A Few Details About My Notes Website

A little while back I created [notes.jim-nielsen.com](https://notes.jim-nielsen.com) and [wrote about why I made it](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/notes-dot-jim-nielsen-dot-com/). I want to write a little more about some of my favorite parts of the site.

## First: It’s Really a Page, Not a Site

I’m not sure I should call it a “website”, as I think of a website as a collection of web pages.

But my “notes website” is just a web page, a single HTML document.

That was intentional. My vision is to keep the page as pure text — no `<img>` tags, `<video>` tags, etc. — because it keeps the site simple and lightweight. It’s one HTTP request, that’s it.

Do I need to build keyword search? Nope, just CMD + F in the browser.

Do I need to build a tagging system? Nope, just CMD + F with `#` prefix.

Do I need to build a system to find links by outbound domain? Nope, just CMD + F and then the domain name.

You can inspect the raw HTML using the devtools. Or, if you want to see the source code that generates that single HTML page, [it’s on GitHub](https://github.com/jimniels/notes/tree/main). 

## Second: “Shuffle” Is My Fav Feature 

I enjoy occasionally pulling up my notes and hitting the “Shuffle” button.

It’s sort of like those “On this day” features from a photo album but for notes, where you look back and think, “Oh yeah, I forgot about that article, that was a good ‘un!”

And because it’s a single HTML page, the code for this is really simple: I have a `<button>` on the page which, when clicked, runs code like this.

```js
const articles = Array.from(
  document.querySelectorAll("article")
);
const min = 0;
const max = articles.length;

document
  .querySelector(".js-shuffle")
  .addEventListener("click", () => {
    const rand = Math.floor(Math.random() * max) + min;
    articles[rand].scrollIntoView();
  });
```

## Third: Themes Are Fun

I wanted to have different color schemes for the site, so with help from my 6y/o son, we made a theme switcher. We browsed [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) together, he pointed out the color combinations he liked, and I put them into the theme.

My favorite part is the names. I needed a name for each of the color sets, so I asked my son to help me name them. Now whenever I visit the site and change the theme, I think of that time we sat at the computer together trying to name variables. His contributions were: Yamble, Halloween, Cadete, and Zizzoo.
