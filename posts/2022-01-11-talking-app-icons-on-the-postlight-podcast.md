# Talking App Icons on the Postlight Podcast

I enjoy the Postlight Podcast. So much, in fact, I’ve documented some of [my favorite excerpts](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2021/fav-excerpts-from-the-postlight-podcast/) here on the blog (and I’ve got another draft of favorite excerpts queued up for another day).

I also enjoy talking about app icon design to whoever will listen.

So you can imagine the joy it was to have those two interests intersect when I appeared on [The Postlight Podcast Episode #314: (Icon)ic Design](https://postlight.com/podcast/iconic-design-with-jim-nielsen-and-michael-flarup).

On it, [Michael](https://twitter.com/flarup) and I talk with the lovely [Chappell Ellison](https://twitter.com/ChappellTracker) and [Nathan Burge](https://postlight.com/about/nathan-burge) at Postlight about the history, craft, and culture of app icon design.

We also touch on how creating [The App Icon Book](https://www.appiconbook.com) is an act of trying to preserve artifacts from a fleeting digital medium, something that borders on being an act of translation more than it does mere reproduction. Here’s me:

> [Trying to preserve app icons in a book is] an interesting task because so much of app icon design is a digitally native medium, right? And so when you move it to print, it’s a [form] of translation that we have to make choices in. The color space, for example, is RGB and now we’ve got to do CMYK. How’s that gonna work out in the translation—[what will change and what will be lost?]
