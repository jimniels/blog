# My Number One “Resource Not Found”

The data is in.

The number one requested resource on my blog which doesn’t exist is:

`/robots.txt`

According to Netlify’s analytics, that resources was requested 15,553 times over the last thirty days.

Same story for other personal projects I manage:

- [iOS Icon Gallery](https://www.iosicongallery.com): 18,531 requests.
- [macOS Icon Gallery](https://www.macosicongallery.com) 10,565 requests.

“That many requests and it serves a 404? Damn Jim, you better fix that quick!”

Nah, I’m good.

Why fix it? [I have very little faith that the people who I want most to respect what’s in that file are not going to do so](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/robots-txt/).

So for now, I’m good serving a 404 for `robots.txt`.

Change my mind.
