# Following Links

I loved [this post from Chris Enns](https://chrisenns.com/2023/11/app-defaults/) (via [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/blog/the-web-is-fantastic/)) where he outlines the rabbit hole of links he ventured down in writing that post.

It felt fun and familiar, as that’s how my own browsing goes, e.g.

“I saw X and I clicked it. Then I saw Y, so I clicked that. But then I went back, which led me to seeing Z. I clicked on that, which led me to an interesting article which contained a link to this other interesting piece. From there I clicked on…”

Discovering things via links is way more fun than most algorithmically-driven discovery — in my humble opinion.

As an analogy, it’s kind of like going on vacation to a new place and staying/living amongst the locals vs. staying at a manicured 5-star hotel that gives you no reason to leave. Can you really say you visited the location if you never left the hotel?

I suppose both exist for a reason and can be enjoyed on their own merits. But personally, I think you’re missing out on something if you stay isolated in the walled garden of the 5-star hotel.

Similarly, if you never venture outside a social media platform for creation or consumption — [or automated AI browsing and summaries](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/treating-the-symptoms/) — it’s worth asking what you’re missing.

Have you ever ventured out via links and explored _the internet_?
