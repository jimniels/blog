# To Make Software Is To Translate Human Intent Into Computational Precision

In [“The Future of Software Development is Software Developers”](https://codemanship.wordpress.com/2025/11/25/the-future-of-software-development-is-software-developers/) Jason Gorman alludes to how terrible natural language is at programming computers:

> The hard part of computer programming isn’t expressing what we want the machine to do in code. The hard part is turning human thinking – with all its wooliness and ambiguity and contradictions – into computational thinking that is logically precise and unambiguous, and that can then be expressed formally in the syntax of a programming language.

The work is the _translation_, from thought to tangible artifact. Like making a movie: everyone can imagine one, but it takes a director to produce one. 

This is also the work of software development: _translation_. You take an idea — which is often communicated via natural language — and you translate it into functioning software. _That_ is the work.

It’s akin to someone who translates natural languages, say Spanish to English. The work isn’t the words themselves, though that’s what we conflate it with.

You can ask to translate “te quiero” into English. And the resulting words “I love you” may seem like a job complete. But the work isn’t coming up with the words. The work is gaining the experience to know _how_ and _when_ to translate the words based on clues like tone, context, and other subtleties of language. You must decipher _intent_. Does “te quiero” here mean “I love you” or “I like you” or “I care about you”?

This is precisely why natural language isn’t a good fit for programming: it’s not very precise. As Gorman says, “Natural languages have not evolved to be precise enough and unambiguous enough” for making software. Code is materialized intent. The question is: whose?

The request ”let users sign in” has to be translated into constraints, validation, database tables, async flows, etc. You need pages and pages of the written word to translate that idea into some kind of functioning software. And if you don’t fill in those unspecified details, somebody else (_cough_ AI _cough_) is just going to guess — and who wants their lives functioning on top of guessed intent?

Computers are pedants. They need to be told _precisely_ in everything, otherwise you’ll ask for one thing and get another. “Do what I mean, not what I say” is a common refrain in working with computers. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve spent hours troubleshooting an issue only to realize a minor syntactical mistake. The computer was doing what I typed, not what I meant.

So the work of making software is translating human thought and intent into functioning computation (not merely writing, or generating, lines of code).
