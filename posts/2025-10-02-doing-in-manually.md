# Doing It Manually

I have a standing desk that goes up and down via a manual crank.

I’ve had it for probably ten years.

Every time I raise or lower that thing, it gets my blood pumping.

I often think: “I should upgrade to one of those standing desks that goes up and down with the push of a button.”

Then there’s the other voice in my head: “Really? Are you so lazy you can’t put your snacks down, get out of your comfy chair, in your air conditioned room, and raise or lower your desk using a little elbow grease? That desk is just fine.”

While writing this, I get out of my chair, star the timer, and raise my desk to standing position. 35 seconds.

That’s the cost: 35 seconds, and an elevated heart rate. 

As I have many times over the last ten years, I recommit to keeping it — mostly as a reminder that it’s ok to do some things manually. Not everything in my life needs to be available to me at the push of a button.
