# A Logo Is an Image, The Image of a Company

*The following passage is an excerpt that has been rewritten and repurposed from a magazine advertisement by Westinghouse Electric in 1963 describing symbols.*

A logo is a an image.
It is a symbol,
a sign,
an emblem,
an escutcheon
...an image.

Logos assume meaning from reality.
They take meaning from causes...
good or bad.
And they give meaning to causes...
good or bad.

The vitality of a logo
comes from effective dissemination...
by a company,
by a community,
by a church,
by a corporation.

A logo needs attending
to garner attention.
It is not a sign of quality,
but a sign of *THE* quality.

A logo is the blending
of form and content.
The logo for Hostess
tastes as good
as the treats it stands for.

Logos do not illustrate
they indicate,
not represent
but suggest,
and are stated
with brevity and wit.

A logo is created
by a designer
but made
by a company.

A logo is an image
...the image of a company.
