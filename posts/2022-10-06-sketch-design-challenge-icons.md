# Sketch Design Challenge: App Icons

Being a self-professed connoisseur of [app](https://www.iosicongallery.com) [icons](https://www.macosicongallery.com), the recent [sketchDesignChallenge on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SketchDesignChallenge) got me admiring all the beautiful app icons folks were making.

I decided to collect a few of my favs and throw them into a picture blog post. Enjoy!

[Mila Shovkoplias](https://twitter.com/mila_shov/status/1573412048813592576) has  lovely depth and color in this airplane.
