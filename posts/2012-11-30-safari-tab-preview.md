# Safari 6 Tab Preview: Show Me More! (In Quantity, Not Size)

Apple's Safari 6 introduced a new tab switching experience. By activating the feature, Safari presents you with a bird's-eye view of open tabs. 100% of the active tab is previewable while only about 15% of it's left and right sibilings are previeweable.

This experience of previewing your tabs is consistent no matter the application's viewport size. You always see 100% of the active tab and about 15% of it's left and right siblings.

Wouldn't it be neat to see the preview of the active tab's siblings grow as the viewport grows horizontally? Essentially, if I had a large monitor I would be able to **see more** of the sibling tabs' previews.

As you can see, as the window grows in size horizontally it would **reveal more** of the sibling tabs' previews **rather than increase** the tab preview sizes. Visually this would help form a more cohesive mental model of the spacial relationship between tabs. It would also help tremendously for any site-comparison a user might be doing.
