# Blogging and Composting

Here’s a thought: blogging is like compositing.

The banana is what you’re after.

But as a byproduct of the banana you get the peel.

And if you compost, you can make good use of the peel.

Similarly, whatever you’re building is what you’re after.

But as a byproduct of whatever you’re building you undoubtedly learned, observed, or cursed at something along the way.

And if you blog, you can make good use of that experience!

Even if the banana was spoiled when you opened it, you can still compost it.

Similarly, even if you ship nothing, there’s a blog post in that failure-to-ship.

Composting recycles organic materials to enrich future plant soil.

Similarly, blogging recycles experience to enrich future projects (and self) with wisdom.
