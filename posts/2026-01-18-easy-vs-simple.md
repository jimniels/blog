# Easy Measures Doing, Simple Measures Understanding

In [his talk](https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2026-01-18T2051), I like the way Jake Nations pits easy vs. simple:

> Easy means you can add it to your system quickly. Simple means you can understand the work that you’ve done. 

I like this framing.

Easy means you can do with little effort.

Simple means you can understand what you do with little effort.

In other words: easy measures the effort in doing, while simple measures the effort in understanding the doing.

For example: `npm create framework@latest` or “Hey AI, build an instagram clone”. These both get you a website with little effort (easy) but do you understand what you just did (simple)?

[It’s easy to get complexity](https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2016-11-18T1230), but it’s not easy to get simplicity.

(I get this is arguing semantics and definitions, but I find it to be a useful framing personally. Thanks Jake!)
