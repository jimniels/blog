# Reverse Domain Name Notation

Go ahead and file this one under ‚Äúcan‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve been in tech this long and only now am learning this.‚Äù

You‚Äôve probably seen it before, especially if you own a Mac.

Those directories full of files whose names start with `com.*`.

Look familiar?

I never knew what those files were or why they were named that way.

But it never bothered me enough to ask or find out.

Then one day I was watching a YouTube video on creating apps in Xcode. 

When prompted for a name following a syntax such as `com.thing.name.bundle`, the narrator said ‚Äúthis is reverse-DNS syntax.‚Äù

ü§Ø

So that‚Äôs what that is!? `com.adobe.service.plist` is, in essence, just a domain name backwards? 

I honestly never saw that.

And now the whole world makes sense.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation):

> Reverse domain name notation (or reverse-DNS) is a naming convention for components, packages, types or file names used by a programming language, system or framework

The syntax is useful because the ordering of the named components gets reversed, surfacing the logical groupings inherent in the designed structure of DNS.

For example, imagine a bunch of my web properties in a list sorted alphabetically:

- `blog.jim-nielsen.com`
- `gimmiedaticon.jim-nielsen.com`
- `sassme.jim-nielsen.com`
- `www.iosicongallery.com`
- `www.jim-nielsen.com`
- `www.macosicongallery.com`
- `www.watchosicongallery.com`

There‚Äôs no discernible meaning to this list of items.

However, there is an inherent grouping to these names since they originate from the domain name system.

If we rename these to follow the reverse-DNS notation and sort them alphabetically, the groupings surface:

- `com.jim-nielsen.blog`
- `com.jim-nielsen.gimmiedaticon`
- `com.jim-nielsen.sassme`
- `com.jim-nielsen.www`
- `com.iosicongallery.www`
- `com.macosicongallery.www`
- `com.watchosicongallery.www`

Now everything in the world makes sense.

Again, surprising I didn‚Äôt know this until now.
