# Measurement and Numbers

Here’s [Jony Ive talking to Patrick Collison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLb9g_8r-mE) about measurement and numbers:

> People generally want to talk about product attributes that you can measure easily with a number…schedule, costs, speed, weight, anything where you can generally agree that six is a bigger number than two

He says he used to get mad at how often people around him focused on the numbers of the work over other attributes of the work. 

But after giving it more thought, he now has a more generous interpretation of why we do this: because we want relate to each other, understand each other, and be inclusive of one another.  There are many things we can’t agree on, but it’s likely we _can_ agree that six is bigger than two. And so in this capacity, numbers become a tool for communicating with each other, albeit a kind of least common denominator — e.g. “I don’t agree with you at all, but I can’t argue that 134 is bigger than 87.”

This is conducive to a culture where we spend all our time talking about attributes we can easily measure (because then we can easily communicate and work together) and results in a belief that the only things that matter are those which can be measured.

People will give lip service to that not being the case, e.g. “We know there are things that can’t be measured that are important.” But the reality ends up being: only that which can be assigned a number gets managed, and that which gets managed is imbued with importance because it is allotted our time, attention, and care.

This reminds me of the story of [the judgement of King Solomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgement_of_Solomon),  an archetypal story found in cultures around the world. Here’s the story as summarized on Wikipedia:

> Solomon ruled between two women who both claimed to be the mother of a child. Solomon ordered the baby be cut in half, with each woman to receive one half. The first woman accepted the compromise as fair, but the second begged Solomon to give the baby to her rival, preferring the baby to live, even without her. Solomon ordered the baby given to the second woman, as her love was selfless, as opposed to the first woman's selfish disregard for the baby's actual well-being

In an attempt to resolve the friction between two individuals, an appeal was made to numbers as an arbiter. We can’t agree on who the mother is, so let’s make it a numbers problem. Reduce the baby to a number and we can agree!

But that doesn’t work very well, does it?

I think there is a level of existence where measurement and numbers are a sound guide, where two and two make four and two halves make a whole.

But, as humans, there is another level of existence where mathematical propositions don’t translate. A baby is not a quantity. A baby is an entity. Take a whole baby and divide it up by a sword and you do not half two halves of a baby.

I am not a number. I’m an individual. Indivisible. 

What does this all have to do with software? Software is for us as humans, as individuals, and because of that I believe there is an aspect of its nature where metrics can’t take you.cIn fact, not only will numbers _not_ guide you, they may actually _misguide_ you.

I think Robin Rendle articulated this well in his piece [“Trust the vibes”](https://robinrendle.com/notes/trust-the-vibes/):

> [numbers] are not representative of human experience or human behavior and can’t tell you anything about beauty or harmony or how to be funny or what to do next and then how to do it.

Wisdom is knowing when to use numbers and when to use something else.
