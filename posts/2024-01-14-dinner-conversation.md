# Dinner Conversation

I love following the blogs of people in tech who have interesting, insightful things to say about the industry and their craft.

I also really enjoy when those same people post little insights into their personal lives. I love seeing the human side of these individuals who give me novel, insightful ways to imagine building on the web.

For example, I think [Dave](https://daverupert.com), and [Rach](https://rachsmith.com), and [Piper](https://piperhaywood.com) do this well (I have bookmarked to try some of Grandma Piper’s [recipes](https://piperhaywood.com/tag/recipes/)).

In the spirit of emulating this attribute I so genuinely enjoy in others, I’m going to try sharing a few personal details. Nothing big or really that notable. Just small little nothings that happen in my life. And it’s exclusively for those subscribed via RSS.

A few months ago, I bought a pack of [TableTopics](https://tabletopics.com/products/family) for my wife as a gift. 

They’re a set of cards and each one has a question like, “Is it more fun to be a parent or a child?”

We pull them out at dinner as conversation starters. Each person gets the chance to answer. Sometimes we go through a couple different cards because nobody has much to say. Sometimes we only get through one card because of the conversation that ensues.

Recently one of the questions was:

“What are the benefits of saving and spending?”

When it came to me, my answer was: “If you save, you can spend.” Our 8y/o quickly followed with his answer: “And if you spend, you can have a good time!”

The next question was:

“If you could learn any language, which would you choose?” 

Our 6y/o said he would choose German. I don’t know why, he refused to elaborate on his reasoning. Seeing as he is in a Chinese immersion class at school, my wife asked him: “Not Chinese?” His reply was that he already knew that, so of course he wouldn’t chose that language.

Next we asked our 4y/o. He said he would learn “Mexico”. I replied, “So, Spanish?” And he said, “No. Mexico.”

Then we came to our 8y/o. He said he would learn “computer” because computers know all languages in the world and if he learned computer he would know them all.

So yeah, dinner conversations are going swell :)
