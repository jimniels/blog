# Apollo and App Icons

As a self-proclaimed app icon-noisseur, I’ve followed Apollo from the sidelines for a while. I absolutely love all the great app icon variations Christian has commissioned for the app. (Photo from [@BasicAppleGuy](https://twitter.com/BasicAppleGuy/status/1666907331114745856?s=20).)

It’s sad to see Apollo go. As [I noted](https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2023-06-21T0810), Christian was a pioneering model for how apps can have more than just one icon.

He commissioned app icon designers to create lots of fun, diverse pieces of artwork for Apollo, ensuring designers got [paid instead of promised “exposure”](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/):

> We ended up with well over 100 custom icons created by incredibly talented designers…(to be clear…I paid them all – there isn't some bs "exposure" agreement…)

When [we made](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/tags/#iconGalleriesBook) [_The App Icon Book_](https://www.appiconbook.com/), we were able to fill an _entire spread_ with just Apollo icon variations. It was wonderful!

Before the app was gone, I wanted to screenshot all the icon variations in the app to keep for my own archival purposes[^1].

There were the “regular” app icon variations:

The “community pack” variations — “Icons created by designers in the Apollo community (and purchased from them by the developer)”.

And my favorite, the “ultra” collection:

Apollo was an authentic patron of the icon arts, and for that I extend my gratitude to Christian and the legacy he leaves with the app.
