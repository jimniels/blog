# Why Make a Website in 2025?

The same reason you would bake a batch of cookies: because you enjoy it — the process itself, but also the result. 

And perhaps, if you like, you share the result with others.

Who is out there asking, “Should I bake a batch of cookies? How well can that act be monetized? Should I do something else instead?”

Do it for the fun of the thing itself.

It doesn’t have to be anymore than that. It can be — [Dave talks about that](https://daverupert.com/2025/09/why-would-anybody-start-a-website/) — but it doesn’t have to be.

Bake cookies because you like to.

Make websites because you like to.
