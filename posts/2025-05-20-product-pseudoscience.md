# Product Pseudoscience

In his post about [“Vibe Drive Development”](https://robinrendle.com/notes/vibe-driven-development/), Robin Rendle warns against what I’ll call the pseudoscientific approach to product building prevalent across the software industry:

> when folks at tech companies talk about data they’re not talking about a well-researched study from a lab but actually wildly inconsistent and untrustworthy data scraped from an analytics dashboard.

This approach has all the theater of science — “we measured and made decisions on the data, the numbers don’t lie” etc. — but is missing the rigor of science.

Like, for example, corroboration.

Independent corroboration is a vital practice of science that we in tech conveniently gloss over in our (self-proclaimed) objective data-driven decision making.

In science you can observe something, measure it, analyze the results, and draw conclusions, but nobody accepts it as fact until there can be _multiple_ instances of independent corroboration.

Meanwhile in product, corroboration is often merely a group of people nodding along in support of a Powerpoint with some numbers supporting a foregone conclusion — “We should do X, that’s what the numbers say!”

(What’s worse is when we have the hubris to think our experiments, anecdotal evidence, and conclusions should extend to others outside of our own teams, despite zero independent corroboration — looking at you Medium articles.)

Don’t get me wrong, experimentation and measurement are great. But let’s not pretend there is (or should be) a science to everything we do. We don’t hold a candle to the rigor of  science. Software is as much art as science. Embrace the vibe.
