# The Mac App Flea Market

Have you ever searched for “AI chat” in the Mac App Store?

I have. It’s like strolling through one of those counterfeit, replica markets where all the goods _look_ legit at first glance. But then when you look closer, you realize something is off.

For the query “AI chat”, there are so many ChatGPT-like apps the results are comical. Take a look at these app icons I pulled from my search:

The _real_ app icon for the ChatGPT desktop app (from OpenAI) is in that collection above. Can you spot it?

Here they are again in a single image:

<img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/ai-icons.png" width="820" height="500" alt="A grid of 45 icons. 1 is the real ChatGPT desktop app for Mac from OpenAI. The others are all look-a-likes." data-og-image />

(It’s the one in the 4th row, 3rd column.)

And those are just black-and-white lookalikes. There are other apps riding the AI/OpenAI wave that look like the [ChatGPT](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ai-bot-al-chatbot-assistant/id6736975220?mt=12) [logo](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ai-chatbot-ask-ai-chat-bot/id6450622517) [just](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chatbot-for-google-gemini/id6740811927) [in](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ai-chat-bot-assistant-ask-ai/id6450978033) [different](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/videogen-ai-video-generator/id6479643532?mt=12) [colors](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chatbot-ai-chat-assistant/id6739469256?mt=12).

The funny thing is: the official ChatGPT desktop app from OpenAI is not even in the Mac App Store. It’s only [available from their website](https://chatgpt.com/features/desktop/), so it won’t show up in the “AI chat” results.

There were lots of other “sort of looks like the official one but isn’t” app icons in my search results, like [this Claude one](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/enclave-local-ai-assistant/id6476614556), [this Grok one](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/grow-ai-ask-ai-chat-assistant/id6741433564), or [this Gemini one](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/g-ai-4-0-ai-chatbot-assistant/id6749970691?mt=12).

Oh, and these apps’ names were also very original. Every spacing and casing combination of “AI”, “Chat”, and “Bot” you can think of. Just look at this sampling:

I mean, look at this one: they named it [“Al Chatbot”](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/al-chatbot-ai-assistant-chat/id6738339696?mt=12) (that's the letter `l` as in “lima”, you can see it better in the URL slug where the letters are lowercase: `al-chatbot`).

Imagine going to store to grab some Nike gear and you find stuff like this (image courtesy of [this post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/crappyoffbrands/comments/apq8sx/nine_out_of_the_hundreds_of_fake_nike_brands_from/)):

What does that say to you about the store you’re visiting?

I always wanted a pair of Mike Jordans, just like I always wanted ChatGPP for my Mac.
