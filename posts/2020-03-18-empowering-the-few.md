# Empowering the Few

While going through some old text files, I stumbled on this old draft of a blog post. How old? Well, in it I talk about having read something from Readability, a now (unfortunately) defunct service. So probably about 2014? Nonetheless, I liked re-reading and it still feels relevant. In fact, my friend [Michael Flarup](https://twitter.com/flarup) recently [expressed a similar sentiment](https://twitter.com/flarup/status/1240323082474176512?s=20) when he released his app icon design course for free:

> I understand how little this does & how insignificant it is, but if I can take even one persons mind off a difficult situation momentarily then I'm happy.

So despite it being a draft from ~6 years ago, I’m still posting it. You might ask, “but Jim, isn’t this just a ploy to reach [your self-imposed quota of 50 blog posts this year](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2020/50-blog-posts-in-2020/)?” My response to that:

Here it is:

I was recently browsing through my recommended reads on Readability and I stumbled on this:

<img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2014/how-to-be-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of a recommended article on Readability from thegaw" width="568" height="206" />

When [thegaw](https://twitter.com/thegaw) recommends something to read, it’s worth reading. If he recommends something worth printing and taping to every wall in my office, well let’s just say I took notice.

The article is titled [“How to be a Great Developer”](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/ed-finkler/2014-january-6) and is written by Ed Finkler (a.k.a. [funkatraon](https://twitter.com/funkatron)). There are a lot of really good insights in the article, I suggest you [take a look](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/ed-finkler/2014-january-6). However, I want to focus on one particular point made in the article:

> Don’t worry about how many people use what you make. Empowering 5 people is incredibly special. They will remember what you did for them.

As far as I know, I’ve never created anything which has been seen and used by millions people. I have, however, [created](http://jim-nielsen.com/#recent-projects) and [written](http://jim-nielsen.com/#published-articles) a few things seen by a few people. I generally have no idea how my handiworks are perceived by others. I simply hope their experiences with them have been pleasant. 

Occasionally, however, I do get small insights into how my projects are received and experienced. One example is [teamcolors](https://teamcolors.jim-nielsen.com), a weekend hackathon project I pieced together when I worked at Arc90. It’s a simple compilation of HEX color values for professional sport teams.

Since its launch, the product has received a few changes and updates, most of them courtesy of people who willing contribute [pull requests for the project](https://github.com/arc90/teamcolors/pulls).   

One day [Github issue #28](https://github.com/arc90/teamcolors/issues/28) came in: a request to fix the way the web page was being *printed*. Honestly, I had never given any thought to the site being printed. When asked about his usage scenario, the guy who submitted the issue [said this](https://github.com/arc90/teamcolors/issues/28#issuecomment-40719405):

> I was working on a local little league web site and wanted to color some text to match the team color…If printing had worked I would have printed up a "booklet" to stuff in my reference files.

I would have never thought someone would use this weekend hackathon project in such a way. I submitted a fix, though who knows how many other issues exist on this project that simply haven’t been discovered yet.

My point is: you never really know how one tiny project might help someone out in an odd way you never imagined. I wouldn’t even go so far as to say this guy was “empowered” by my tiny project. More likely it was simply the resolution to a tiny problem he was facing, but that’s good enough. I’m going to go ahead and state the obvious: empowerment or kindness doesn’t have to be at scale to be of value.
