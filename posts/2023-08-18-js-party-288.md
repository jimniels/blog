# My Guest Appearance on JS Party #288

My frequent ramblings on this blog garnered enough of the attention of [Jerod Santo](https://changelog.social/@jerod) that he graciously invited me to come on the JS Party podcast to talk about, well, my blog posts.

Which ones? To name a few:

- [Language-Level Toll Roads](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/language-level-toll-roads/)
- [The Art of Knowing When to Quit](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/art-of-knowing-when-to-quit/)
- [Subscribe Wherever You Get Your Content](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/subscribe-wherever-you-get-your-content/)

Even just talking about the Deno KV thing (from “Language Level Toll Roads”) helped me clarify where my angst was coming from a bit more. In fact, I even came up with this graphic to illustrate it:
