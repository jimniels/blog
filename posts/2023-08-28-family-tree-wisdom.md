# Family Tree Wisdom

Ha, I love it!

It got me thinking: I’d love to hear more folks’ “wisdom from the family tree”. Stuff like Chris shared, “My grandpa used to say…”

I immediately had a few family members come to mind who repeatedly quoted the same phrase. In fact, I did a quick internet search and turns out some of these are derivative quotes from other people that pre-date any of my in-laws. That said, in my mind these quotes are forever tied to these people.

- “Nobody ever got to the end of their life and said, ‘I wish I hadn’t been so kind‘.” — Grandma
- “I’m not young enough to know everything.” — Uncle
- “What you’re saying might be true, but I don’t believe a word of it.” — Dad
- “If everybody threw their problems in a pile, once we saw everyone else’s we’d grab ours back fast.” — Grandpa
