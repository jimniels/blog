# My Office Space

I’ve always had an internal struggle with my office workspace. I see lots of pictures of beautiful workspaces. I sit on zoom calls with people who have wonderful backgrounds. I watch recordings of people who appear to have the complete setup. I read articles about new office spaces. All of it leaves me wanting more from my own space. 

But I also have a three young kids and a small house with no garage. So “my” office space is not really mine; nor is it exclusively an office. I do consider myself lucky though. My office resides in an attachment to our house that requires I go outside to get to it. Its separateness is a good thing — enough to give me the space I need. But the space itself, that’s what leaves me wanting more.

My computer desk and chair are in that room. But it’s also a storage room for strollers, bikes, camping gear, fishing poles, motor oil, golf clubs, and more. I want to kick all that stuff out and make that space “my own” but the family’s needs for storage just don’t allow it right now. And that’s fine, I get it. That’s my stage of life. One day I’ll have the chance to make my office space “my own” — whatever that means, I honestly fear I’m just too lazy to do it ha.

All of that is context for something I recently read from Steven King’s book _On Writing_. He gives a piece of advice that really helped me transcend my inner struggle for a dream office and feel better, however momentarily, about my current situation.

In the book, you read all about his life story around writing: all the not-so-great places he lived and worked before hitting it big, and then what happened when he did.

> [I want to tell you about] my desk. For years I dreamed of having the sort of massive oak slab that would dominate a room — no more child’s desk in a trailer laundry-closet, no more cramped kneehole in a rented house. In 1981 I got the one I wanted and placed it in the middle of a spacious, skylighted study…For six years I sat behind that desk either drunk or wrecked out of my mind, like a ship’s captain in charge of a voyage to nowhere.

> A year or two after I sobered up, I got rid of that monstrosity and put in a living-room suite where it had been…In the early nineties, before they moved on to their own lives, my kids sometimes came up in the evening to watch a basketball game or a movie and eat pizza. They usually left a boxful of crusts behind when they moved on, but I didn’t care. They came, they seemed to enjoy being with me, and I know I enjoyed being with them. I got another desk—it’s handmade, beautiful, and half the size of the _T.rex_ desk. I put it at the far west end of the office, in a corner under the eave.

Then he gives this piece of advice:

> Put your desk in the corner, and every time you sit down there to write, remind yourself why it isn’t in the middle of the room. Life isn’t a support-system for art. It’s the other way around.

As a father with kids, it’s helpful to remind myself of this advice. Here’s what I take from that.

Jim: put your desk in space that’s yours, but don’t worry about curating or preserving it as _the_ centerpiece. And don’t get upset when life happens around it. My workspace isn’t what life revolves around.

They say “a cluttered desk is a cluttered mind” and I get the sentiment. For me personally, I need a space to work and I can’t work if stuff is constantly in the way. But Jim, don’t resent life for happening around it.

Somewhat humorously, it kind of reminds me of [that photograph of Putin at his table](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60573261) where he conducts business.

Why does he do that? I don’t know. Perhaps there’s a psychology of intimidation there, sure. But I also think there’s a desire to express the symbolism of the space: I am important and this is where all the important stuff I do happens. Make it big. Make it clean. Surround it with pomp and circumstance.

I’m not going to lie, that’s often what I want to do with my office space. But then I remember King’s advice that life doesn’t revolved around the desk.

It’s ok to have a bit of humility in your space. Perhaps a dose of it is even deserved.

(The above is what I like to tell myself now and is in no way a judgment of anyone who takes pride and care in their space. If anything, save this post and hit me up with it in ten years when I have a big fancy setup and have forgotten my own advice — or rather, King’s.)
