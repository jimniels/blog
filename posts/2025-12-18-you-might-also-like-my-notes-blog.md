# You Might Also Like: My Notes Blog

If you subscribe to this blog, you must like it — right? I mean, you are subscribed to it.

And if you like this blog, you might also like [my notes blog](https://notes.jim-nielsen.com).

It’s where I take short notes of what I read, watch, listen to, or otherwise consume, add my two cents, and fire it off into the void of the internet.

It’s sort of like a “link blog” but I’m not necessarily recommending everything I link to. It’s more of “This excerpt stood out to me in some way, here’s my thoughts on why.” 

It’s nice to have a place where I can jot down a few notes, fire off my reaction, and nobody can respond to it lol. At least, not in any easy, friction-less way. You’d have to go out of your way to read my commentary, find my contact info, and fire off a message (critiquing or praising). That’s how I like it. Cuts through the noise.

Anyway, this is all a long way of saying: if you didn’t already know about my notes blog, you might like it. [Check it out](https://notes.jim-nielsen.com) or [subscribe](https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/feed.xml).

Today, for example, I posted lots of grumpy commentary.
