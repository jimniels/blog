# An Ode to An Event Apart

I’m not a big globe-trotting conference attendee. I’ve only been to a handful in my career.

The event I remember most fondly is _An Event Apart: Austin_ in 2013. In my memory (which, granted, might be fuzzy) that conference was more about _ideas_ than any specific technology. What I don’t remember is a schedule full of talks centered around frameworks, tools, or DX products.

For example, I remember [Chris Coyier](https://www.flickr.com/photos/placenamehere/10164389336/in/pool-aeaaustin13/) talking about [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). But I don’t remember (nor do my handwritten notes indicate) the talk as a _pitch_ for Sass. Instead, the talk felt like instruction around the generalized idea and practice of using preprocessors. What I remember about that talk is how Chris helped me understand what code preprocessing is, why you might want it, and Sass was an example in the context of CSS. I think that talk has served me well through the years with the rise and fall of many code processing/transformation tools (for CSS, JS, and more).

[Ethan gave a talk](https://www.flickr.com/photos/placenamehere/10162326235/in/pool-aeaaustin13/) titled “The Map & The Territory” that was more conceptual than technological. It struck a chord with me, so much that [I blogged about it](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2014/defining-beauty-on-the-web/) (back when I wasn’t blogging much):

> the beauty of a website is found in embracing its inherent nature: in being accessible, useful, and empowering—the very attributes, essence, and fundamental mission of the web.

Jeremy gave a talk called “The Long Web”, again more about ideas than any specific tech (as he is want to do — [his talks](https://adactio.com/articles) are great). It even ended with [him playing a musical number](https://www.flickr.com/photos/placenamehere/10164311216/in/pool-aeaaustin13/).

[Karen gave a talk](https://www.flickr.com/photos/placenamehere/10162433475/in/pool-aeaaustin13/) I think about every time I hear the phrase “content is king”. 

All of these talks timeless, at least as I remember them. The conference was 10 years ago, but I feel like the same talks could be given today and they’d be just as relevant.

What I remember about AEA were talks _descriptive of principles_ for building on the web, instead of talks _prescriptive of tools_ for building on the web (which is what I’ve got at a lot of conference since). I really enjoyed that. It was inspirational.
