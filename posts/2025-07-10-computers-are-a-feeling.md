# Computers Are a Feeling

Exploring [diagram.website](https://diagram.website), I came across [The Computer is a Feeling](https://github.com/timhwang/nyrc/blob/main/NYRC%201%20-%20The%20Computer%20is%20a%20Feeling.md) by Tim Hwang and Omar Rizwan:

>  the modern internet exerts a tyranny over our imagination. The internet and its commercial power has sculpted the computer-device. It's become the terrain of flat, uniform, common platforms and protocols, not eccentric, local, idiosyncratic ones. 

Before computers were connected together, they were primarily personal. Once connected, they became primarily social. The purpose of the computer shifted to become social _over_ personal.

> The triumph of the internet has also impoverished our sense of computers as a tool for private exploration rather than public expression. The pre-network computer has no utility except as a kind of personal notebook, the post-network computer demotes this to a secondary purpose.

Smartphones are indisputably _the_ personal computer. And yet, while being so intimately personal, they’re also the largest distribution of behavior-modification devices the world has ever seen. We all _willing_ carry around in our pockets a device whose content is largely designed to modify our behavior and extract our time and money.

> Making “computer” mean computer-feelings and not computer-devices shifts the boundaries of what is captured by the word. It removes a great many things – smartphones, language models, “social” “media” – from the domain of the computational. It also welcomes a great many things – notebooks, papercraft, diary, kitchen – back into the domain of the computational.

I love the feeling of a personal computer, one whose purpose primarily resides in the domain of the individual and  secondarily supports the social. It’s part of what I love about the some of the ideas embedded in [local-first](https://localfirstweb.dev), which start from the principle of owning and prioritizing what you do on your computer first and foremost, and then secondarily syncing that to other computers for the use of others.
