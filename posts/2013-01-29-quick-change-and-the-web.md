# Quick Change and the Web

Can you really change the world over night?

> In both the web and in our greater community, I see people despair that change doesn’t happen more quickly. That we can’t make the world better overnight. But if this year has taught me anything, it is that we can’t ignore the hard work that needs to be done. And that we all must take up the charge to make the world better than it we found it — both on the web and in our society. - [Jason Grigsby](http://alistapart.com/article/what-we-learned-in-2012)

What is so great about the web is that , with a single great idea, you **can** often build it overnight. Or at least in a few days. No bureaucracy. No paperwork. No meetings. No board approval.The [Arc90 Hackathon](http://lab.arc90.com/hackathon/2012/) was a good example of this to me.  Get a good idea, start a conversation, excite others, build it, release it to the community, and if its great, you'll begin sowing the seeds of change.

From there you just iterate.
