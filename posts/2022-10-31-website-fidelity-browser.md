# Website Fidelity: Browser Perspective

I‚Äôm super intrigued by this idea of [website fidelity, which I wrote about previously](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/website-fidelity/), and [I have more I want to say](https://twitter.com/jimniels/status/1582917485300310016) about it, so here we go.

One thought I had while writing the original post was: if we‚Äôre going to start supporting this idea of website fidelity now, wouldn‚Äôt forking a web browser be the most intriguing prototype to build?[^1]

Website owners aren‚Äôt necessarily incentivized to start stripping stuff out of their websites in order to support lower fidelities (including a fidelity of zero JavaScript). What you need is like an agent: somebody who works on your behalf as a user and can do for you what site owners won‚Äôt ‚Äî a user agent if you will ü•Å.

Imagine forking a browser and doing nothing else except building one new feature: a website ‚Äúfidelity‚Äù control. For illustration‚Äôs sake, imagine a little slider in the browser‚Äôs chrome.

The background window shows NPR‚Äôs website at full fidelity with styles and inline images while the foreground window shows NPR‚Äôs website in barebones HTML." />

How would it work?

Imagine a scale of fidelity, from `0` to `1` and you set the fidelity to `1`. When you make a request, for example to `npr.org`, the browser would fetch all necessary resources and render everything exactly as the website owner intended.

However if you then turned the fidelity down, for example to  `0`, and requested `npr.org` again, the browser would fetch the initial HTML resource but in the act of parsing it would begin to ignore (or transform) external resources.

- `<link rel=stylsheet>` tags would be ignored and not fetched.
- `<script>` tags would be ignored, with inline scripts not executed and external scripts not fetched.
- `<img>` tags would be transformed to links (`<a href=imgSrc>alt text</a>`) so the image isn‚Äôt fetched and displayed inline but remains accessible (same for things like `<video>`).
- Inline `style` attributes would be stripped so only the default UA styles apply.

The browser would do everything it could to remove anything but the most basic HTML and, in doing so, skip fetching, parsing, and rendering loads of external resources (while still preserving access to content, just not directly inline).

Granted, this might break the website you visit. If the site owner has built their site from a posture of progressive enhancement, stripping out resources should still leave the site functional as these kinds of resources are designed to work as _additive enhancements_ to the page. However, without a posture of progressive enhancement, the site will likely break as these kinds of resources are designed as _critical dependencies_ to the page.

This is where having website owners provide different fidelities would prove to be a better, more customized experience as it improves the chances a website‚Äôs experience being free of bugs. However, gaining adoption from website authors could be a difficult problem to tackle especially since we‚Äôre talking about a technological feature that favors the needs and preferences of website users _over_ website authors (an ethos [built into the web itself](https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies), mind you). 

Building a browser (or extension[^1]) that does this would be a much more practical approach in the here and now. For example, if thousands (or even millions) of users started expressing a preference for lower fidelity websites in order to decrease bandwidth usage, save battery power, increase privacy, decrease clutter, simplify UI/UX, or even just accommodate a personal preference, it might help drive adoption of website fidelity by site owners as they‚Äôd want  control to provide a more customized (functioning) experience for their users.

## Examples

To contrast these two different approaches, imagine a scenario where ‚Äúwebsite fidelity‚Äù is a browser feature. Website authors only provide one experience, so the browser controls fidelity based on the user‚Äôs preference.

Taking NPR as an example, here‚Äôs their current website today (full fidelity of `1`):

<img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2022/browser-fidelity-slider-1.0.png" width="1062" height="831" alt="Screenshot of NPRs homepage at ‚Äúfull fidelity‚Äù, including styled type, inline images, a radio streaming widget, etc." />

Now, if the browser took that same HTML and stripped out styles, didn‚Äôt run scripts, swapped out images, etc., you might get something like this:

<img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2022/browser-fidelity-0-stripped.png" width="1063" height="831" alt="Screenshot of NPRs homepage with styles, scripts, and images stripped out, revealing barebones HTML with default user agent styles." />

Less than ideal, to be sure, but it would preserve the user‚Äôs preference for a lower fidelity experience (and thus use less bandwidth, less battery, less compute, etc.).

Now, imagine a website owner that provided varied experiences based on the user‚Äôs preference (communicated via, for example, a [request header](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/website-fidelity/)). At full fidelity (`1.0`), you‚Äôd have NPR‚Äôs current experience:

<img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2022/browser-fidelity-slider-1.0.png" width="1062" height="831" alt="Screenshot of NPRs homepage at ‚Äúfull fidelity‚Äù, including styled type, inline images, a radio streaming widget, etc." />

At a lower fidelity (`0.1`), you‚Äôd have an experience more akin to [NPR‚Äôs current ‚Äútext-only‚Äù version](https://text.npr.org) of their site.

<img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2022/browser-fidelity-slider-0.1.png" width="1062" height="831" alt="Screenshot of NPRs text-only homepage with styled text and layout." />

And at the lowest fidelity (`0`), you‚Äôd have an experience akin to the ‚Äútext-only‚Äù version, but with all author styles removed and only the default user agent styles applicable.

<img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2022/browser-fidelity-0.png" width="1062" height="831" alt="Screenshot of NPRs text-only homepage with no styles or layout, only the default user agent styles are applied." />

Together these would constitute a sliding scale of fidelities provided by NPR that cater to the varied needs and preferences of website users.

<img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2022/browser-fidelity-npr-desktop.gif" width="612" height="464" alt="An animated GIF of three browser windows and the ‚Äúfidelity slider‚Äù moving up and down while the website‚Äôs viewport changes in fidelity from low to high and back to low." />

(And, of course, you‚Äôd want to provide this feature across devices, like mobile.)

<img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2022/browser-fidelity-0-to-1-mobile.png" width="1778" height="1170" alt="Screenshot of three mobile views of NPR, going from low fidelity (pure HTML, not styles) to high fidelity (styles, images, audio player, etc.)" />

Note that ‚Äúfidelity‚Äù in this case is not solely a control over the appearance and functionality of the website, but the actual content of the site itself. For example, at full fidelity on a news site you might have an image, title, byline, and short description for each article whereas at low fidelity you might only have the title for each.

I want to stress this point: I see the promise of website ‚Äúfidelity‚Äù not just as a preference for less JavaScript and CSS but content itself. Providing users this kind of control would require website owners be involved, as I‚Äôm not sure you could do that well solely as a browser feature or extension.

## The Fidelity Scale

After publishing [my initial post on this topic](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/website-fidelity/), [Vladimir Prelovac](https://vladimir.prelovac.com/) reached out to me saying browsers can absolutely force lower fidelity preference for the user. He notes that [the Orion browser](https://browser.kagi.com/) on iOS has a ‚ÄúData Saver Mode‚Äù which effectively does this to a degree by blocking the loading of images, scripts, and web fonts.

He went on to formulate a website fidelity scale. I had imagined one in my mind, but not formulated it and written it down. Vladimir‚Äôs first stab is illustrative of how a browser feature like this _could_ work, so I share it here for illustration purposes:

- `0` HTML + Browser CSS
- `.1` Simple CSS (e.g. classless CSS libs)
- `.2` On-page CSS
- `.3` Images
- `.4` Web Fonts
- `.5` JavaScript
- `.6` Cookies + localStorage
- `.7` Ads/Trackers

There‚Äôs a lot more to work out here, but this is good for illustrating an idea.

## Closing Thoughts

While getting websites authors to support numerous versions of their websites in varying degrees of fidelity would be ideal ‚Äî as it could include content in the definition of ‚Äúfidelity‚Äù ‚Äî it likely won‚Äôt happen unless its value can be shown as essential to users. In that case, a browser-level fidelity feature seems the most practical place to start.

In addition, persuading website authors to build their sites in a progressively-enhanced fashion would allow a browser-level fidelity feature to be much more effective. Why? Because it could strip out features and functionality from a website without breaking it, as the site would designed from the ground up to function at the equivalent of fidelity `0` with all enhancements layered in.

[^1]: I‚Äôve never built a full-fledged browser extension, but if the extension could plug into the DOM‚Äôs parsing and intercept resources before they are fetched then that could be better than forking a browser, as that‚Äôs where you‚Äôll get a lot of bandwidth, CPU, battery savings. You‚Äôre not trying to strip out styles and scripts, you‚Äôre trying to skip fetching, parsing, and rendering them altogether.
