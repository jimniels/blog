# A Letter of Feedback To Anyone Who Makes Software I Use

I don’t much enjoy being a lab rat to your half-baked ideas. 

I can tell when your approach to what I use is: “Ship it and let’s see how people respond.”

Well let me tell you something: I’m not going to respond.

My desire to give you constructive feedback is in direct correlation to your effort to care — about your communications, about what you ship, even about what you _don’t_ ship.

Just because you ship some half-baked feature doesn’t mean I’m going to take the time to tell you whether I find it any good.

Doubly so in the age of AI. I know how easy it is for you to ship slop, why should I take the time to formulate careful feedback on your careless output?

I can disagree with product decisions, but I won’t get mad at thoughtfulness and care. I respect that. 

But I will very much disagree with _and_ get mad at product decisions devoid of thought and care. I have no respect for that.

[It’s not really worth my time to respond to such a posture of shipping software](https://mastodon.social/@jimniels/115696622197427043), and yet here I am writing about it. Because I care about the things I choose to (or am required to) use.

So this is my one-time, general-purpose piece of feedback to all such purveyors of digital goods and tools. Just because nobody tells you that what you shipped sucks, doesn’t mean it’s worth keeping. You can’t measure an apathetic response because it is, by definition, the absence of data.
