# Optimize for Nothing

> Anything new is by nature without precedent — meaning, without data to know whether it will work or not.

I recently read a piece by the folks at The Browser Company about how they are [optimizing for feelings](https://browsercompany.substack.com/p/optimizing-for-feelings):

> When Olmstead crafted Central Park, what do you think he was _optimizing_ for? Which metric led to Barry Jenkins’ _Moonlight_? What data brought the iPhone into this world? The answer is not numerical. It’s all about the feelings, opinions, experiences, and ideas of the maker themself.

They ask a good rhetorical question: what products that you love were created in optimization around a metric?

I like the against-the-grain nature of the piece. They bemoan “the relentless optimization of everything in our world” and conclude:

> We believe this mindset has led us to a very specific place: one of efficiency, productivity, and profit…but not a place of humanity.

I’ll buy that. It reminds me of [a quote from Eric Gill](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2021/book-notes-eric-gill-typography/) where he says: “We have elected to order manufacture upon inhuman lines; why should we ask for humanity in the product?”

And yet, after arguing against optimization, they themselves say they are optimizing — albeit for feelings not metrics.

Maybe that’s inevitable. If you want to run a business, you have to optimize for _something_ to turn a profit? I’m no good at business, so don’t ask me.

But for argument’s sake, what would push this piece further is to hear a claim like: “We’re not optimizing for anything. Rather than optimize around a metric, we are building something based on our own sensibilities and opinions of what makes the world more enjoyable to us.”

What I find profound and universal about anyone’s work is what they observe in themselves and, in turn, reflect in their work to the world — not any one optimization.
