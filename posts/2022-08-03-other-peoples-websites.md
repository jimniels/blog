# The OG Social Network: Other People’s Websites

“Organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.”

That’s Google’s stated mission.

But what if the world's information becomes locked in disparate silos, [inaccessible to a search engine](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2020/the-missing-hit-and-the-open-web/)? Is there a future where Google dies on the vine, not enough content to make their engine useful?

Walled social networks were always a problem for Google. 

But now there’s Slack. Discord. Substack. Newsletters. Paywalls. All walled and inaccessible to Google — an existential problem.

Perhaps history will conclude killing Google reader killed Google, an overly-simplistic conclusion but poetically ironic nonetheless.

Google+ was Google trying to mimic the walled garden of Facebook — their “how” of extracting value from the people of the internet.

But they already had an answer for Facebook’s News Feed in front of them: Blogger / Google Reader, the read / write of the internet.

The mistake was killing Reader to make Plus a success. Google’s judo move would’ve been to embrace the open web as a social network. Not _their_ network but _our_ network.

They provide the tools – Reader, Blogger, Search — we provide the personal websites. The open, accessible, indexable web as The Next Great Social Network.

A dream? Alas.

Google has stood on top of the success of communities. Groups of people who write content and curate interestingness by linking to other things for humans. [Could PageRank have been invented today?](https://twitter.com/carribeiro/status/1477804467735117827?s=21)

So much online activity is less public now as companies strive to capture the value we create being online with each other — the value I’m creating right now by writing this and linking to other things, things not on Discord or Slack or Confluence but on other peoples’ websites.

Other people’s websites: the OG social network.
