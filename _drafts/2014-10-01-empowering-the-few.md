I was recently browsing through my recommended reads on Readability and I stumbled on this:

 Usually when [thegaw](https://twitter.com/thegaw) recommends something to read, it’s worth reading. If he recommends something worth printing and taping to every wall in my office, well it’s probably pretty good.

The article is titled *[How to be a Great Developer](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/ed-finkler/2014-january-6)* and is written by Ed Finkler (a.k.a. [funkatraon](https://twitter.com/funkatron)). There are a lot of really good insights in the article, I suggest you [take a look]((https://the-pastry-box-project.net/ed-finkler/2014-january-6)). However, I want to focus on one particular point made in the article:

> Don’t worry about how many people use what you make. Empowering 5 people is incredibly special. They will remember what you did for them.

As far as I know, I’ve never created anything which has been seen and used by millions people. I have, however, [created](http://jim-nielsen.com/#recent-projects) and [written](http://jim-nielsen.com/#published-articles) a few things seen by a few people. I generally have no idea how my handiworks are perceived by others. I simply hope their experiences with them have been pleasant. 

However, occasionally I get small insights into how my projects are received and experienced. One example is [teamcolors](http://teamcolors.arc90.com/), a weekend hackathon project I pieced together when I worked at Arc90. It’s a simple compilation of HEX color values for professional sport teams.

Since its launch, the product has received a few changes and updates, most of them courtesy of people who willing contribute [pull requests for the project](https://github.com/arc90/teamcolors/pulls).   

One day [Github issue #28](https://github.com/arc90/teamcolors/issues/28) came in: a request to fix the way the web page was being *printed*. Honestly, I had never given any thought to the site being printed. When asked about his usage scenario, the guy who submitted the issue [said this](https://github.com/arc90/teamcolors/issues/28#issuecomment-40719405):

> I was working on a local little league web site and wanted to color some text to match the team color…If printing had worked I would have printed up a "booklet" to stuff in my reference files.

I would have never thought someone would use this weekend hackathon project in such a way. I submitted a fix, though who knows how many other issues exist on this project that simply haven’t been discovered yet.

My point is: you never really know how one tiny project might help someone out in an odd way you never imagined. I wouldn’t even go so far as to say this guy was “empowered” by my tiny project. More likely it was simply the resolution to a tiny problem he was facing, but that’s good enough for me.
