*The following passage is an excerpt that has been rewritten and repurposed from a magazine advertisement by Westinghouse Electric in 1963 describing symbols.*

A logo is a an image.  
It is a symbol,  
a sign,  
an emblem,  
an escutcheon  
...an image.  

Logos assume meaning from reality.  
They take meaning from causes...  
good or bad.  
And they give meaning to causes...  
good or bad.  

The vitality of a logo  
comes from effective dissemination...  
by a company,  
by a community,  
by a church,  
by a corporation.  

A logo needs attending  
to garner attention.  
It is not a sign of quality,  
but a sign of *THE* quality.  

A logo is the blending  
of form and content.  
The logo for Hostess  
tastes as good  
as the treats it stands for.  

Logos do not illustrate  
they indicate,  
not represent  
but suggest,  
and are stated  
with brevity and wit.  

A logo is created  
by a designer  
but made  
by a company.  

A logo is an image  
...the image of a company.
